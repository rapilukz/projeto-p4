I purchased this for my son and he is enjoying it!', 'I never had before a mouse like this one, is fast, light, great sensation. Love it', ""First off this is one of razer's better mice especially for the price. The 2.4 dongle connection is seamless and I have personally never had a single problem with it. I use it with my xbox series x/s and it is flawless just plug the dongle into the systems usb and boom you're good to go. The m1 and m2 buttons have a small amount of post travel, but nothing serious. The side buttons are nice and crisp with almost no pre or post travel. With time the m1 and m2 buttons may become a little sponge like feeling because of the way the shell is removable. The mouse is able to use AA or AAA batteries depending on which weight you desire and the battery life is amazing. The included skates are smooth ptfe, but there is not an extra set in the box. The mouse is on the smaller side so if you've got larger hands this may not be for you. Claw or fingertip grip only unless you have tiny hands you will not be palm gripping this. All in all it is a nice mouse for fps games or basic productivity and if you are able to find it for under $50 jump on it."", 'Es un mouse muy bueno, cómodo y práctico de usar, me gusta usarlo con Bluetooth en mi laptop cuando trabajo pero cuando voy a jugar algo conecto el dongle, si la batería se está agotando puede perder la conexión ocasionalmente.', '', 'The product was legit just for my regular gaming and useful for other tasks as well.', 'This mouse only works continuously on a USB 3.0 port.

It provides a smooth and consistent surface for your mouse to glide on, allowing for precise movements and accurate tracking.

Then I downloaded a free drive cloning program (search online, there are several) and followed a YouTube video on the process. Basically, you connect the cord to the new hard drive and plug it into a USB slot on your computer. Then you run the program which copies all of your data from the old drive to the new drive (took about an hour). Once it's done, that's when you install the new drive and it worked like magic.

Which is what I did for 2 out of the 3 years that I've owned it. Why? Because... I didn't know that the drive was the problem. I've got it installed in the Ultrabay in a Thinkpad T440p, and I thought THAT might have something to do with it. I didn't realize that this was the problem until I was doing some research on new drives and saw one of the random techie reviews say this one is NOT a boot drive.\nHonestly, I would've returned it if I had known that the drive was the culprit sooner (just because it isn't usable for what I wanted it for and I had no other use for it), so I'm letting ya'll know that before anyone else makes my same mistake.

Razer Kraken Kitty RGB USB Gaming Headset: THX 7.1 Spatial Surround Sound - Chroma RGB Lighting - Retractable Active Noise Cancelling Mic - Lightweight Aluminum Frame - for PC - Quartz Pink,Computer Parts,124.99,Amazon,4.5 out of 5 stars,"[""I've been using this headset for about 6 months, and I'm really liking it!\nThe sound quality is great, better than any other headset I've used. The sound has helped when playing games a lot compared to my earbuds and my old headset. it also doesn't cause any issues with my glasses which a lot of other headsets do.\n\nThe mic is really nice too if you're using it for Discord or gaming but I wouldn't use it for something like streaming. It has a built-in mute button by pressing the mic (and an indicator light for when it's muted so you don't accidentally leave yourself muted) and there's a little wheel on the back of the left earphone to adjust the sound volume.\n\nIt's also fully customizable RGB with Razer's Synapse software. You could set each light on the headset to a different color if you wanted to for some reason, and it can also sync up with all other RGB Razer products. I have mine synced with my mouse.\n\nMy two biggest issues with the headset are:\n1. that I have to have it plugged directly into my computer if I have the lights on.\nWhen I tried using my USB hub, the sound will cut out and the lights will turn off for a handful of seconds at random.\n\nAnd 2. While it says it has cooling gel in the earcups, I haven't noticed it helping a ton when it comes to my head overheating while wearing the headset for an extended period.\n\nTL;DR\nIf sound and mic quality are your top priority, you could probably find a better headset for the $140 price, but if you want a cute pink headset that has RGB and matches the other Razer Quartz products and still sounds really nice, I would absolutely recommend it. It also goes on sale quite often, I got mine for under $100."", ""Got these babies in 2020 during the pandemic. It was part of my first PC set. Just two months ago, I started having issues:\n• Spatial sound and stereo sound switching between eachother (Eventually I had to uninstall spatial sound)\n\nI mainly used my headset for minor gaming so I'm not too sure about what type of sound is great or not, but I've never had an issue and the sound display has always been clear for me. Headset doesn't give me any issues but they are a little big. I used them almost 4-5 times a week the past 4 years (reduced usage a lot this year due to other needs), and on some days it was for long periods of time as well. They've lasted me at least 4 years without any issues and honestly, they've been great for me so far. The mic quality is also so much better than some headsets out there that are more than $100+.\n\nAnother thing, some headsets usually start falling apart after lots of usage. The cushion for the ears are leather but they've never once ripped, began flaking or anything of the sort. A little FYI that I didn't do too much to take care of them except put them on a stand and clean them every once in a while."", ""This is the very first headset that I've bought for gaming and I love it! I wanted a cute headset so the aesthetic already was enticing and so is the brand (my husband has a headset from the same brand). I wouldn't really consider myself experienced with technology/gaming so I can't quite give a detailed and super informative review for specific parts of the headset but...\nas far as I'm aware, sound quality/cancellation is amazing. It really feels like the headset cancels out other noises besides my own voice, of course. It was very [eerily] quiet when I first put them on because it felt like I was all alone in my head with my thoughts. But when I started streaming, I ended up getting used to it as well as hearing my own voice clearly (like, I know it's my voice, but it felt a little bit like I was hearing it from another perspective). It's a strange feeling and a new experience for me, but I like it. It's also quite comfortable and I love that I can pull out the little mic part. OOH and also, pretty colors! It lights up, which makes it look even cuter!\nFor my first gaming headset, I would definitely recommend it <3"", ""I'd give these suicide prone headphones 9.5/10 For great style and audio quality. Downside is the microphone is barely average and you'll have to replace the whole damn thing about every 2-3 years. I'd highly recommend buying the three year protection plan because the cord coils in on itself and destroys itself. I've had these last just over 2 years before the audio starts to cut in and out and becomes unbearable.\n\nIrregardless if I have to make an asurion claim every 2-3 years for a busted ass cord, these are by far my favorite headphones. They're cute, sparkly, comfortable, and have amazing audio quality. Exchanging these every 2 years just seems like a headphone tune up to me. Get the 3 year plan and you'll be alright"", ""So... I have slowly begun to realize that Razor headphone mics break within a year usage. I have tried several types including this one (my friend owning the pink) and my brother also owning a different pair but the mics do not last very long. One day they are working and the next... well... they don't.\n\nWith the kitty one's (my friend including) one of our ear pieces also blew out? She had the pink version and I had the black and both just... had the left ear blow and the mic just stopped working as well.\n\nIt really sucks because the headphones are SUPER cute! I love them a lot but they are not worth the price if you get barely a year usage out of them... But hey! They are great otherwise, at first they are great, the mic quality is decent, the sound is great, they are decent at noise cancelling when you have nothing playing but again that whole year usage is kind of a damper for the price that I pay."", 'El mejor sonido!

My grip on the mouse is fingertips only and have grown used to travel mice. I find the fingertip grip gives me more delicate control of mouse movements than a large ergonomic mouse does.\n\nI let my wife try the mouse and she loved it so we had to buy a second mouse. She has smaller hands and it fits her palm nicely. The clicks are nearly silent. The scroll wheel has a nice feel to it, just enough tactile feedback to let me know it's working.\n\nWe haven't measured the life of the battery in it but it seems to last a few months at least.\n\nWe both appreciate the wake up feature of the mouse. Just moving it wakes it up. We have had mice that required a click to waken and find those very annoying because the wake up click would often result in an unwanted screen click.\n\nNeither of us are gamers and can't offer any information but the mice do seem to be very sensitive and responsive. I did experience some frustrating lag with the mouse for a time but changing the receiver dongle to a USB 3.0 port took care of the problem. It wasn't caused by the mouse. I still don't understand why a USB port suddenly gets weird and slow but it does happen with some computers. We run older desktop tower computers with Linux systems so the occasional issues could be either the hardware or caused by some random software update. Switching ports seems to take care of the problem."", ""This is the first nonstandard mouse I've ever had and the shape is very, very comfortable for my hand to sit on.

As someone who values a peaceful environment and seamless functionality, this mouse has exceeded my expectations in every aspect.\n\nFirst and foremost, the standout feature of this mouse is its silent operation. The near-silent clicks and ultra-quiet scrolling make it a game-changer for those who work in shared spaces, libraries, or quiet offices. The reduction in noise is remarkable and has significantly contributed to a more tranquil and focused work environment.\n\nIn addition to its silent operation, the mouse maintains Logitech's renowned standard of quality and performance. The ergonomic design fits comfortably in my hand, providing a natural grip that minimizes strain during extended use. The wireless connectivity via the 2.4GHz receiver ensures a reliable and lag-free connection, offering the freedom to work without being tethered to the computer.\n\nThe battery life of the M330 SILENT PLUS is impressive, delivering up to 24 months of usage on a single AA battery. This exceptional longevity means that I can go about my work without the inconvenience of frequently replacing or recharging the battery.\n\nThe precision and responsiveness of the mouse are outstanding, allowing for smooth and accurate cursor control across various surfaces. Whether I'm working on a desk, couch, or even my lap, the mouse tracks consistently and reliably.\n\nSetup was a breeze, as the mouse is plug-and-play, requiring no additional software installation. This simplicity, combined with the reliable wireless connectivity, ensures a hassle-free user experience.\n\nIn summary, the Logitech M330 SILENT PLUS Wireless Mouse has become an indispensable tool for my daily computing needs.

Intel® Core™ i5-14600KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) - Unlocked,Computer Parts,293.99,Amazon,4.6 out of 5 stars,"['This professional CPU isn\'t designed for the average user. However, if you\'re a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I\'ve acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers—Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.\n\nFor those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—\n\nAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.\n\nWhen selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn\'t your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.\n\nThe 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It\'s a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...\n\nDid I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I\'d advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.\n\nAs of this date—4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that\'s a discussion for another time.\n\nThe X3D Elephant in the room: Don\'t worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...\n\nWe\'ll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn\'t primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn\'t allow for it since it\'s not monolithic, which wouldn\'t be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn\'t fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""\n\nIndeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there\'s no cause for concern.

The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.\n\nSo what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.\n\nI mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard.

However, if you\'re a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I\'ve acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers—Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.\n\nFor those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—\n\nAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.\n\nWhen selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn\'t your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.\n\nThe 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It\'s a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...\n\nDid I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I\'d advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.\n\nAs of this date—4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that\'s a discussion for another time.\n\nThe X3D Elephant in the room: Don\'t worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...\n\nWe\'ll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn\'t primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn\'t allow for it since it\'s not monolithic, which wouldn\'t be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn\'t fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""\n\nIndeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it!

It wasn\'t the port. It wasn\'t the hub. It wasn\'t the fact that it was IN a hub. It still did this with different keyboards, and with everything else unplugged. It has continued to do this at least once, and usually closer to five times (three or four times while I was writing this review), every day until I finally bother to replace it.\n\nOverall, it just...doesn\'t work. I might\'ve just gotten a faulty mouse, but I\'m mostly just astounded by the fact that it\'s SO bad that it\'s affecting OTHER devices. Just save up some more and spend 40 on a mid-line gaming mouse or something.\n\nTLDR: Moody software, buggy hardware, don\'t bother', 'Its good for people who arent gonna be spam clicking their mouse for 1000000 clicks per second. good for Roblox Fortnite and overwatch.', 'Muy buen mouse, lo recomiendo 100% vale mucho la pena por si precio y calidad 👌', '', 'Een toppertje in zijn categorie!!!', '', 'As a massive Destiny 2 fan, I love buying different kinds of Destiny merchandise.

I will come back and update if I have insightful longer term updates to provide.\n\nBefore jumping into my $.02 I think it\'s useful to prefix review input with past experiences and what I\'m comparing my product against.\nWhen thinking about music and overall sound quality, I have Apple AirPod Max\'s that blow these things out of the water. These can\'t touch the Max\'s bass, nor do they sound as smooth and natural out of the box (as everyone has said, these are quite flat out of the box). I also have SennHeiser MB660s that have been my work conference/music-at-the-desk and occasionally my gaming headphones w/o a mic and even they sound far, far better for music and even in some games (assuming OOB setup, not fully configured with Sonar).\n\nI am also going to address the lack of ANC outside of the pros/cons list, because I think the use cases of this headset are unique compared to general over the hear headphones. Despite my opinion, I do think it\'s odd the wireless version of these have ANC and these don\'t. However, I think if you want pure, fairly competitive or natural and detailed game sound quality above all else, you do not want ANC hissing and adding pressure to your ear. If you haven\'t owned in or over ear headphones with ANC you might not realize that the constant pressure they create on your ears cancelling out noise will fatigue your ears for long gaming sessions. I also don\'t think when I need to hear footsteps exactly where they are around me and where they\'re going in Warzone that I want to try to separate ANC hiss from game noise. I guess this could be easily addressed by putting the feature in the headphones and letting the game profile turn it on off.\n\nPROS:\n- the sound profile is very flat out of the box. I think that opens the most options wit the Sonar EQ software to adjust them to more peoples preferences.\n- if you read this and are a gamer who plays games that has voice chat, I totally under-estimated and under-valued what the GameDac can do. The GG software splits up game sound, your game mic, and your game chat mix into 3 individual audio streams. The best part of this, is games like Warzone let you split which audio device the game uses for those audio outputs. You can then press the dial on the dac once and adjust the output between chat and game sound. This means I can dynamically adjust hearing my team or the game - if people have low mics, are mumbling, or are obnoxious children blaring music into their mic during the game I can curtail that instantaneously.\n- despite no ANC the ear cushions do a really good job of blocking out most sound\n- I think the ear muffs and head band could be more comfortable than my Sennheisers and AirPod Maxes. These things just disappear on my head. I have never gamed more than an hour and a half straight without taking them off, but I thought nothing of them being on my head for that long.\n- the mic is excellent, especially with the ClearVoice ""AI"" filter\n- the game presets are pretty good out of the box. the sound quality and clarity are excellent. despite lacking in music impact, I have to admit these are probably are setup as they should to give the most accurate, clear in game sound. the sound imaging to pinpoint players is spot on, the volume levels are good. I cannot take these more than 75% in war zone without hurting my ears.\n\nCONS:\n- the Sonar software component of the GG suite requires a SteelSeries account to enable. This is totally unacceptable and just shows where SteelSeries is trying to monetize by getting your e-mail address. I have never found an aspect of Sonar that requires SteelSeries knowing who I am or utilizing an account to manage or enable my product.\n- I don\'t think if you\'re an audio snob you\'ll have a jack of all trades headset. as I mentioned above I have at least 2 over ear headphones that aren\'t even in the same solar system for music\n- stop buying the hype about the marginal better sound quality from the DAC. 99/100 normal people with untrained ears with average hearing can\'t tell the difference between compressed bluetooth audio and lossless wired headphones, all else equal. I bought the wired because I have so many bluetooth or wireless devices in my headset that when I want to game, I do not want interruptions, drop outs, hitches or blips.', 'Short version: It’s a really good headset on its own but once you combine it with the GameDAC the customization it allows is something everyone should spend a little time to learn to personalize it best.\n\nLong version: Everything about this headset goes above and beyond. As long as you know the basics in your audio settings it’s as simple as plug and play. Though combine that with their steel series software (which btw compared to the software of other brands like razor for example, steel series software barely touches any resources and will not be a hindrance to have running in the background.) The pads around the ears are soft and very comfortable allowing for wearing as long as you’d like. At no point is there ever really discomfort. The GameDAC with the software makes it easy to control your volume using the smooth to the touch dial and a very simple interface that is easy to understand with a useful little tutorial on how to use it. This overall should be good enough for the general consumer to get their hands on this thing but for audiophiles, they get to have their cake and eat it too! The software allows you to play with an equalizer in the software that also has the audio split between several categories (Game, Chat, Media, Aux, and Mic). So you can set your Game channel to allow you to gain the advantage in your game or allow you to have a more immersive experience. Along side that you can have the Media channel to make whatever you watch or listen to sound as crisp as possible allowing you to enjoy every little detail to your favorite songs and movies.\n\nOverall phenomenal product and I recommended it for anyone looking for a quality headset without shelling out $500+ one some “super duper high quality headset” when for this price gets ya right up there for a fraction of the cost.', ""The left ear did not work when it came out of the box also I got mine from Best buy just to get it the same day cuz I'm impatient. When I was comparing apples to apples the dial on the one from Amazon did not feel completely smooth it felt almost as if there was small piece of stuck in there kind of similar to how the dial feels after years of use. The one from Best buy that was not defective was super duper smooth when turning the knob.. obviously it'll be different sellers that you're buying it from but just know that the dial should be super smooth you should feel absolutely no obstruction and the headset is very loud if it's not very loud it's defective. The right ear that did work was not very loud. The one I got from Best buy that was working properly was very loud.

"Logitech G903 LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse W/ Hero 25K Sensor, PowerPlay Compatible, 140+ Hour with Rechargeable Battery and Lightsync RGB, Ambidextrous, 107G+10G optional, 25,600 DPI, Black",Computer Parts,94.90,Amazon,4.6 out of 5 stars,"['I\'m on my computer for work all day long, so I\'m always on the lookout for great accessories that make my life easier, and this mouse is one of them. It\'s a little pricey, but it\'s very responsive across multiple surfaces and feels great in my hand. That said, I do have a few minor complaints.\n\nFirst of all, I bought the charging pad with my mouse and it worked great for about 6 months. Then I lost the USB dongle in a move so I purchased a replacement mouse, but even though it\'s recognized and shows up in the Logitech G Hub software, the pad have never charged the mouse since and I have no idea why. That said, I can charge the mouse with a USB cable from <15% to 100% in a couple of hours and a full charge last for weeks even with heavy use so it\'s not a huge deal, although it might suggest that the rather expensive charging pad isn\'t really worth the expense.\n\nSecond, there\'s a button next to the mouse wheel that switches the wheel from free spinning to tensioned mode where the mouse will stop moving as soon as you stop pushing it. I like the free spinning mode as it\'s a great way to quickly jump around a long document or web page, but the wheel on this model is very loose and tends to scroll drift the instant you lift your finger off the wheel even if you\'ve stopped the movement several times by gently pressing down on the wheel. I\'ve owned many different mice over the years and this is the first one where the wheel was so loose it would constantly drift like that, and I know it\'s specific to the model because I own 3 of these mice for my various personal and work computers and they all exhibit the same behavior.\n\nFinally, I always reassign one of my mouse buttons to double-click. I\'ve learned over the years that if I physically double-click the little metal tab under the mouse button fatigues in less than a year and starts doing that annoying double-click when you only clicked once thing, so I always assign a button and use that instead. Now, there\'s no problem assigning a button to double-click, the catch is the G Hub software. It has this really obnoxious thing where it auto sleeps after like 5-10 minutes of mouse inactivity, so when you move your mouse again it plays a loud ding and for a couple seconds only basic left click and right click work before G Hub wakes up and pushes the custom button assignments into the mouse again.\n\nI\'ve spoken with tech support at Logitech and there is no way to prevent G Hub from auto sleeping, that\'s just the way the software is designed, but there is a mouse memory mode. Basically, instead of communicating constantly with G Hub, you can just have the mouse ""remember"" its button assignments in a kind of offline mode. So no need for G Hub and no need for that annoying pause every time I move my mouse after reading for a few minutes. Except for some reason double-click is in a category of button assignments that doesn\'t qualify for the mouse memory mode, and according to tech support there\'s no way to get around that, which is kind of a bummer.\n\nAnyway, that\'s about it. I do like the mouse, but there is room for improvement in my book.', 'I purchased 3 mice and was all set to send the most expensive one back. I kept it instead. Although a bit large, I can move it around easily, access buttons and enjoy the sensitive touch.it is very quiet.\n\nIt is a ""game changer"" for me as I have several health issues that interfere with my gaming. This mouse solves these issues .', 'It is now March 2024, and I have been using my G903 Lightspeed since early 2021. After 3 years, this mouse has been reliable, comfortable, and great for either hand.\n\nI found it naturally easier to use left handed for some reason, but I mimicked that grip with my right hand, and it works equally well. I switch hands sometimes to minimize chances of repetitive stress injury when working all day. I reverse the mouse buttons digitally, using system settings.\n\nOne thing I especially love is the replacement side buttons (normally for forward and back in a browser). The mouse comes with static / fake replacement buttons, which are held on quickly with in-built magnets, and I use them on both sides so that I never worry about clicking them by accident. Great feature if you truly use it ambidextrously!\n\nThe only thing negative I can say is that sometimes the sides are slightly slick depending on how my hand is that day. It is rare that it affects my use, but I wish they would have put a small strip of smooth rubber to negate this. Usually hand warm from using the mouse rids this problem.', ""I bought this a year ago in the attempt to find a wireless mouse that behaved like a good old fashioned wired mouse.\n\nAll other wireless mice I have tried were very unstable as far as the the pointer lag and intermittent movement goes. There was no way to learn where the pointer would end up as it would move, skip, stop, move again, etc while simply moving the mouse either slowly or quickly. Horrible tracking.\n\nThe only thing that worked accurately was an ancient wired microsoft mouse I had.\nMy mouse 'pad' is the arm of the couch made of a fitted velour type cloth that came with the couch.\nI tried a blue tooth optical mouse, jumpy. Splurged on the flagship model of logitech that tracks on glass, also jumpy. Sent that thing back. Didn't like the strange shape either.\n\nI then tried this one. It uses a different usb dongle which works on a different frequency and higher speed for the radio connection. Success! This mouse tracks very well. No jumping around or skipping of movement at all, just like the wired mouse.\n\nI think it is because it uses 'Light speed wireless' as the connection rather than bluetooth or wifi.\n\nIt has a reputation of bad switches from the other reviews. Only now is it showing some minor signs of the switches being imperfect and that is hardly noticeable so far. I have sourced replacements for them when they do go bad.\n\nBattery life is fairly good. Not nearly as good as the old kind that used 2 AA batteries. Maybe 1-2 months with heavy use and turned on 24/7. Old ones that use AA (blue tooth) last more like a year or more.\n\nThe settings can be stored on the mouse itself so no need to have to have some software running all the time to retain settings. The software it uses is Logitech G Hub. I'm on Win7 and used an older version of that. If I allow it to update itself, it will fail to run on Win7. Once you have setup your switches, LED colors, etc and stored that on the mouse, the Logitech software can be terminated and set to not start as a windows service. I have turned off all the LEDs since the nice lights consume power from the battery.\n\nExcellent mouse overall."", 'Esta increible el tiempo que aguanta la carga en si me encanta no eh tenido ni un problema con el mio lo eh cuidado muy bien y ta chevere ty', '', 'My old G502 was starting to show trace of it age so I decided to upgrade to a wireless mouse and boy I am satisfied!

It\'s too narrow, especially if held with ring finger on right-click, middle finger on scroll wheel(aka 1-3-1 grip). If you use 1-3-1 grip, ambidextrous mouse fits best.\n\nG903 fits well. The hard side surfaces on G903 has an advantage over typical soft rubber/silicone sides because it\'s resistant to pinkie finger nails digging a crater in the soft material over time. I prefer the hard, easy to clean surfaces\n\nThere are enough reviews about the double-click issue for me to expect a button replacement down the road. Quality control isn\'t good enough at this price.\n\nEDIT:\nAs expected, left switch died, not responding; I replaced both switches. Have since used many other models(mostly razers) and I\'m increasing my rating from 4 to 5 stars. This is still one of my favourites, because of it\'s mix of gaming and productivity features; Gaming mouse with a hyperscroll wheel is rare.\n\nG903 is similar to G Pro, except g-pro lighter, caters to gaming no hyperscroll.\n\nIt\'s shape would be better with higher mid section. Add optical switches, AA battery option, bluetooth, usb-c usb dongle holder, and it would be perfect!', ""I am a right-handed person, the ambidextrous design bothers some people, but I find it comfortable.\n\nI use the thumb buttons for push-to-talk(PTT), one for in-game PTT, other for discord, etc, PTT.\nDon't bother trying to use the buttons opposite to your thumb side(at least not for gaming), it's a very awkward reach.\nHyperscroll is very good for websites, the non-hyperscroll is very tactile and suitable for gaming.\nDPI changer is fine, but I don't really use it often.\nNo latency. Apparently, it's supposed to be faster than wired, but honestly you can't tell the difference.\nSensors are technically supposed to be more accurate than the old model, not really humanly discernible considering how accurate sensors are nowadays.\n\nI'm an original G903 owner, so the rest of the review will be in comparison to the old version of the G903, which, in my opinion, was the best mouse.\n\nSnagged this for $150, $50 cheaper than what I paid for the original G903 when it first came out.\n\nPlease take into account the fact that I have lighting disabled, it really adds nothing to the experience.\nI'm leaving this review because it arrived at half charge and after two weeks of non-stop usage, the battery finally went down to 3 percent. Charge is really fast too. After about a minute, the battery went to 20%. Amazing.\n\nLow battery indicator is not obnoxious like it is on the old G903. The old model would flash red and would be really distracting, the new model is more like a fade in and out really slowly, so it's not annoying the crap out of me.\n\nIcons in the logitech software still don't load properly, however, a reinstall which I am too lazy to do might fix it, regardless, everything is still functional in it. The UI doesn't look like it was designed a decade ago, which is a plus I guess.\n\nDon't get the powerplay mat, it's pointless when the battery life is this good. Just charge it once a month while you're watching a TV show episode, and you're good. Off switch is pretty pointless considering it has a seamless auto-sleep function, only necessary for travelling.""]","3,668"

I’ll be Frank, the screen is amazing. 2k is giving me amazing frame rates on all the major games and the clarity, frame rate is night and day difference. I am playing modern warfare 2- war zone on ps5 with superb vision and responsiveness. Along with a lot of other demanding games. I have no complaints for this price point and really recommend it as honestly with 4K on a ps5 the best you’re gonna get is 60 hz and that juice isn’t worth the squeeze.

The Modular Design lets you only plug in what is needed to make the system work, which allows you to avoid unnecessary clutter of unused cables unlike traditional PSU\'s. if i apply the concept of this power supply to building a PC, the Cable Management will be much easier as you will have extra space to store excess cables and can retain the unused cables in your box outside of the case until needed.\nDuring bench testing of my new system which contains the following parts:\n- ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Hero\n- AMD 7900X 170 W\n- Corsair Dominator Titanium DDR5\n- Gigabyte Nvidia RTX 3060 12G\n- Crucial T700 2Tb Gen 5 PCIe M.2\n- Micron 500 Gb Gen 4 PCIe M.2\n- RM1000e PSU 1000 W\n\nI was able to boot, and bench test (Cinnebench 2024) my system and this Unit didn\'t spin the cooling fan up once for the first 5 minutes of the test. Once the fan kicked on it was so unbelievably quiet. My current system has an EVGA 650W power supply in it and that thing sounds like a leaf blower sometimes. The Corsair PSU functions in a ""Zero RPM"" state only spinning up when needed and the fan is so quiet you cant really tell when its on unless you are looking at it.\n\nI plan on Building y system once my case arrives, and will update my review about installation and cable management, and include a few pictures to boot. I Ordered Corsair Pro Sleeved cables for my build so I will not be using the stock cables in my final build, however I did use them for bench testing and I can say that the stock cables are nice, flat ribbon cables with a durable exterior coating. They are flexible yet sturdy, and can be easily Cable Managed with zip-ties and Velcro straps. Overall first impressions i would Definitely recommend this to people who need a great power supply with intuitive modular cable management for cases like the Corsair 4000.', ""It's a power supply. If it provides completely stable power, is quiet, and you don't have to think about it after installing it, it's great.\n\nThis one is completely stable, is quiet, and easy to install. Including 12vhpwr in the box was a nice touch, and it's a lot nicer to work with than the Nvidia dongle that comes with the 4k series GPU's. Not much else to say about a power supply.\n\nNo real cons to this one other than it's a little stinky out of the box and for the first couple of days you use it. I assume it's the powdercoat they painted it with rather than the scent of raw power, but it lasted a day or two in a high airflow case. Captain Stinky here has been rock solid since I first booted up the system I powered it with, though, so it's not much of a complaint."", ""subtle branding with plenty of in box cables that are tied to not be messy.

Seems to be well made but in the instructions, it said to only use the provided cables. The reason I ordered this style is because I was replacing my Modular Roswill brand that failed and wanted to keep the Higher end cables installed. However, even though it was correct style, there was just enough difference that my existing cables either didn't plug in and latch snuggly or the separation molding on the plugs themselves was not matching up to allow some to plug in to the PSU at all. The Positive, is that the ribbon cables provided did work and fit all connections. This is a small issue and probably because of lack of industry standard across brands but other than this I would have given a higher rating.

I keep a full monitoring app in my system tray and noticed at 100% load, at max turbo which is 3.9 (base 2.8), it stays under 60c and never throttled down during the entire operation I was doing (I think video conversion or file compression). Not to mention, I never hear my fan. This was a hot laptop and was specked by Intel to run that hot. So, for anyone who thinks paste isn't so important, think again. Imagine running at full Mhz?!

Recently, I purchased the ARCTIC MX-4 (4 g) Premium Performance Thermal Paste and I have been extremely impressed with its performance.\n\nOne of the standout features of the ARCTIC MX-4 is its high thermal conductivity. It is designed to provide optimal heat transfer from the processor or graphics card to the heatsink, which helps to keep the components cool even under heavy loads. This is especially important for gamers and other power users who demand the highest levels of performance from their systems.\n\nAnother great feature of the ARCTIC MX-4 is its long durability. Unlike some other thermal pastes that tend to dry out and lose effectiveness over time, the MX-4 is designed to last for years without any degradation in performance. This means that you won't have to worry about replacing the thermal paste on your CPU or GPU for quite some time.\n\nIn terms of safety, the ARCTIC MX-4 is an excellent choice. It is non-conductive and non-capacitive, which means that it won't cause any damage to your components if it comes into contact with them. Additionally, it is very easy to apply, thanks to its non-viscous consistency, which makes it spread easily and evenly.\n\nOverall, I have been extremely happy with my purchase of the ARCTIC MX-4 Premium Performance Thermal Paste.

Most of my currently installed games (World of Warcraft, Dying Light 2, FallOut 76, FarCry 6, GTAV, Fortnight, etc) are getting frame rates at or near the 163 HZ limit, at ultra settings (No Ray Tracing or DLSS 3 except in Dying Light 2, and that game looks amazing and still gets over 100 fps!).\n\nI am also using a second MSI monitor (Mag274 @1080P) for chat and communications programs while gaming, and as usual with Nvidia video cards this has no problems with 2 monitors, both using display port.\n\nThe Asus Tuf RTX 4070 Ti Super never gets very warm.
