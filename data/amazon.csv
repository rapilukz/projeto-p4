I purchased this for my son and he is enjoying it!', 'I never had before a mouse like this one, is fast, light, great sensation. Love it', ""First off this is one of razer's better mice especially for the price. The 2.4 dongle connection is seamless and I have personally never had a single problem with it. I use it with my xbox series x/s and it is flawless just plug the dongle into the systems usb and boom you're good to go. The m1 and m2 buttons have a small amount of post travel, but nothing serious. The side buttons are nice and crisp with almost no pre or post travel. With time the m1 and m2 buttons may become a little sponge like feeling because of the way the shell is removable. The mouse is able to use AA or AAA batteries depending on which weight you desire and the battery life is amazing. The included skates are smooth ptfe, but there is not an extra set in the box. The mouse is on the smaller side so if you've got larger hands this may not be for you. Claw or fingertip grip only unless you have tiny hands you will not be palm gripping this.

I love it, and I can\'t recommend it enough.', ""Low price got me, plus the name, I've used Kingston memory for years. The SSD drive has worked perfectly for over a month. It replaced an old slow hard drive and is so much faster than the old hard drive. Boot up time is so quick it surprises me. No problems, what more can I say."", 'I am using this ssd in a Sabrent portable hard drive case. The two items make a good combination at a very reasonable price. At this budget price point it is quite fast. I store mostly EAC flac files on it and would definatly buy again.', ""I had a needed for a drive to boot via USB and perform testing of various installation and configuration instructions. This drive while not huge meets my needs for this purpose. So far the drive has held up to multiple reinstalls of Windows, multiple encrypting/decrypting rounds of the entire drive, many reboots, etc. It appears to be performing well. I am running it via a USB 3.0 external controller but it appears to be performing quickly (at least it isn't noticeable to me."", 'While this product is very much an entry level SSD using a DRAMless design, if you have an older secondary system that may have been using an 80-120GB SSD (such as the older SATA 2 ones from intel, OCZ and other companies), then this SSD offers a noticeable performance boost.\n\nI used this to replace a failed SDSSDH-120G-G25 120GB Sandisk ultra SSD, which was used as the main system drive for a media center PC. The process to restore was quite fast, as I only needed to restore a system image from my weekly backups.\n\nDetails about the drive:\nI am unsure of variations in production, but the unit I received, details the following for the controller and NAND. While I have not personally experienced, it, some people have complained about the company changing hardware while keeping the same model number so long as the hardware meets or exceeds advertised specs. If this holds true, then it can mean the potential for variation between devices received, but the combination of Controller and NAND that I received, has worked well\nController: Phison PS3111-S11\nNAND: Toshiba 15nm TLC NAND\nStrengths:\nGreat read performance: Tasks such as bulk transfers (datasets that do not need a very high IOPS), would hover around 500-540MB/s. From my initial stress testing before using it as a system drive for the media center PC, I used it as a secondary game drive for 2 days, trying games such as Ark Survival Evolved, and The Witcher 3. For load times, performance was in line with higher end drives such as my Samsung 850 Pro, thus showing that games that are not IO intensive, do not need a very high end SSD to get great load times.\n\nDecent write speeds for a DRAMless TLC drive: Write speeds are slower due to the DRAMless design and small process node TLC NAND. If copying a single massive file e.g., 20+GB video, you can expect speeds in 450MB/s range, but if you are simply copying a folder with mixed files, such as a folder of image files in the 15-30MB range, will drop to the 280-350MB/s range. The peak speeds you see in most synthetic benchmarks are only achievable on linear reads or linear writes.\n\nLow temperatures: One benefit to lower end SSDs, is they do not generate much heat. Even when installed on the SSD mounts located behind the motherboard tray (where there isn’t much ventilation), the drive peaked at 30C during a stress test, even though the ambient temperature in the room was 23C\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nLarge drop in performance compared to higher end SSDs, when it comes to high IO mixed workloads, such as if an application such as a screen recorder video editor using it as a scratch disk. You can have as little as 15MB/s worth of high IOPS writes (many tiny writes), and it will take linear reads down from the 500-540MB/s range, down to the 350MB/s range, wall while having no CPU bottleneck (no signs of the process scheduler using 100% of CPU time from any o the cores). This is common for all DRAMless drives where they struggle with mixed workloads. It still handles these tasks better than any of the older SATA II based SSDs that I have used, but it is much slower than modern MLC NAND SATA III SSDs with DRAM onboard.\n\nThe use of 15nm TLC NAND will mean that write endurance will be low on these drives. This is perfectly fine for users who will mostly be doing reading such as using the drive for game installs, or as a system drive for a computer where you will not be working with many files on the SSD. In my case, since the media is stored on a NAS, the SSD will see very little in the way of writes. The 240GB model is rated for 80TB of writes over the life of the drive. This basically means that it would be a bad choice for write intensive workloads. This ultimately reduces the versatility of the drive, but as long as you understand the limits, and thus make an informed decision, this is a great value for an SSD.', 'I have three of these that I’ve purchased, they are between 2-3 years old, and after all this time all three still write well above 450MB/s and just below 500MB/s (transferring large ISOs slow it down a little, nothing bad though) as advertised.\n\nThey are sturdy and reliable, run very cool, and I’ve had zero issues with these in the 2-3 years I’ve used them.\n\nI recently took one out of an old Dell (A10 APU laptop that was 10 years old) and use it as a spare drive in my desktop now and it formatted and everything just fine. It flies through all tasks I give it running Dev Drives with Dev Home on Windows 11 Pro Dev Channel and all Linux operations are superb. I even put it through a test benchmark yesterday and it never passed 57 degrees (and I was pushing it hard). Excellent drives that have delivered. I still prefer Crucial for larger capacities, but do not underestimate these, the price/performance ratio is superb.', 'A Kingstom sempre cumprindo o que promete.

Razer Kraken Kitty,Razer Kraken Kitty RGB USB Gaming Headset: THX 7.1 Spatial Surround Sound - Chroma RGB Lighting - Retractable Active Noise Cancelling Mic - Lightweight Aluminum Frame - for PC - Quartz Pink,Computer Parts,130.00,Amazon,4.5,"[""I've been using this headset for about 6 months, and I'm really liking it!\nThe sound quality is great, better than any other headset I've used. The sound has helped when playing games a lot compared to my earbuds and my old headset. it also doesn't cause any issues with my glasses which a lot of other headsets do.\n\nThe mic is really nice too if you're using it for Discord or gaming but I wouldn't use it for something like streaming. It has a built-in mute button by pressing the mic (and an indicator light for when it's muted so you don't accidentally leave yourself muted) and there's a little wheel on the back of the left earphone to adjust the sound volume.\n\nIt's also fully customizable RGB with Razer's Synapse software. You could set each light on the headset to a different color if you wanted to for some reason, and it can also sync up with all other RGB Razer products. I have mine synced with my mouse.\n\nMy two biggest issues with the headset are:\n1. that I have to have it plugged directly into my computer if I have the lights on.\nWhen I tried using my USB hub, the sound will cut out and the lights will turn off for a handful of seconds at random.\n\nAnd 2. While it says it has cooling gel in the earcups, I haven't noticed it helping a ton when it comes to my head overheating while wearing the headset for an extended period.\n\nTL;DR\nIf sound and mic quality are your top priority, you could probably find a better headset for the $140 price, but if you want a cute pink headset that has RGB and matches the other Razer Quartz products and still sounds really nice, I would absolutely recommend it. It also goes on sale quite often, I got mine for under $100."", ""Got these babies in 2020 during the pandemic. It was part of my first PC set. Just two months ago, I started having issues:\n• Spatial sound and stereo sound switching between eachother (Eventually I had to uninstall spatial sound)\n\nI mainly used my headset for minor gaming so I'm not too sure about what type of sound is great or not, but I've never had an issue and the sound display has always been clear for me. Headset doesn't give me any issues but they are a little big. I used them almost 4-5 times a week the past 4 years (reduced usage a lot this year due to other needs), and on some days it was for long periods of time as well. They've lasted me at least 4 years without any issues and honestly, they've been great for me so far. The mic quality is also so much better than some headsets out there that are more than $100+.\n\nAnother thing, some headsets usually start falling apart after lots of usage. The cushion for the ears are leather but they've never once ripped, began flaking or anything of the sort. A little FYI that I didn't do too much to take care of them except put them on a stand and clean them every once in a while."", ""This is the very first headset that I've bought for gaming and I love it! I wanted a cute headset so the aesthetic already was enticing and so is the brand (my husband has a headset from the same brand). I wouldn't really consider myself experienced with technology/gaming so I can't quite give a detailed and super informative review for specific parts of the headset but...\nas far as I'm aware, sound quality/cancellation is amazing. It really feels like the headset cancels out other noises besides my own voice, of course. It was very [eerily] quiet when I first put them on because it felt like I was all alone in my head with my thoughts. But when I started streaming, I ended up getting used to it as well as hearing my own voice clearly (like, I know it's my voice, but it felt a little bit like I was hearing it from another perspective). It's a strange feeling and a new experience for me, but I like it. It's also quite comfortable and I love that I can pull out the little mic part. OOH and also, pretty colors! It lights up, which makes it look even cuter!\nFor my first gaming headset, I would definitely recommend it <3"", ""I'd give these suicide prone headphones 9.5/10 For great style and audio quality. Downside is the microphone is barely average and you'll have to replace the whole damn thing about every 2-3 years. I'd highly recommend buying the three year protection plan because the cord coils in on itself and destroys itself. I've had these last just over 2 years before the audio starts to cut in and out and becomes unbearable.\n\nIrregardless if I have to make an asurion claim every 2-3 years for a busted ass cord, these are by far my favorite headphones. They're cute, sparkly, comfortable, and have amazing audio quality. Exchanging these every 2 years just seems like a headphone tune up to me. Get the 3 year plan and you'll be alright"", ""So... I have slowly begun to realize that Razor headphone mics break within a year usage. I have tried several types including this one (my friend owning the pink) and my brother also owning a different pair but the mics do not last very long. One day they are working and the next... well... they don't.\n\nWith the kitty one's (my friend including) one of our ear pieces also blew out? She had the pink version and I had the black and both just... had the left ear blow and the mic just stopped working as well.\n\nIt really sucks because the headphones are SUPER cute! I love them a lot but they are not worth the price if you get barely a year usage out of them... But hey! They are great otherwise, at first they are great, the mic quality is decent, the sound is great, they are decent at noise cancelling when you have nothing playing but again that whole year usage is kind of a damper for the price that I pay."", 'El mejor sonido!

Logitech M330 SILENT PLUS Wireless Mouse,"Logitech 910004905 M330 Silent Plus Mouse, 2.4 Ghz Freq/33 Ft Wireless Range, Right Hand Use, Black",Computer Parts,15.99,Amazon,4.6,"['I am a mobile gamer. I originally bought this mouse about two years ago. When it says this mouse is silent, it is silent! The clicks are smooth and light. I play games like League of Legends, Diablo and Path of Exile, which are games that require constant use and clicking of the mouse. When I say constant clicking, I mean hundreds and hundreds of clicks a minute. My original mouse lasted me over a year, then eventually the left mouse button stopped functioning. I am more than impressed with the longevity of the mouse, especially with the constant torture I put it through. The mouse got used easily 8-12 hours a day with constant clicking and gaming and held up over a year. When my first one broke, I bought a different mouse and was I unimpressed. The new mouse claimed to be silent, but I soon learned, it was not. Hearing hundreds of back to back loud clicks every minute gets old in less than a minute. I instantly spent the little bit more and bought this mouse again. The profile of the mouse is nice, and the way it sits in your hand is also nice. It has a smooth and low profile and isn’t bulky like some other mice. The wireless signal is also good, I’ve stood up to 15 ft away from my laptop and still been able to use the mouse totally fine! I would highly recommend this to anyone! Overall is a great mouse to use and is an outstanding product!', 'It is a great, simple, wireless mouse. It is perfectly responsive, there is almost no sound at all when clicking, it is ergonomic, it has no unnecessary buttons. It works equally well on my MacBook Pro as it does on my Windows laptop, and neither computer has any problems with it.\n\nThe only flaw is that could be moderately larger, or at least come in different sizes for different hands. For me it fits well enough although I would prefer a larger version of this device.', ""I wanted a silent mouse or as close as possible so my clicking wouldn't disturb my wife.\n\nI have large hands but find that a small mouse works well and don't expect it to fit my palm. My grip on the mouse is fingertips only and have grown used to travel mice. I find the fingertip grip gives me more delicate control of mouse movements than a large ergonomic mouse does.\n\nI let my wife try the mouse and she loved it so we had to buy a second mouse. She has smaller hands and it fits her palm nicely. The clicks are nearly silent. The scroll wheel has a nice feel to it, just enough tactile feedback to let me know it's working.\n\nWe haven't measured the life of the battery in it but it seems to last a few months at least.\n\nWe both appreciate the wake up feature of the mouse. Just moving it wakes it up. We have had mice that required a click to waken and find those very annoying because the wake up click would often result in an unwanted screen click.\n\nNeither of us are gamers and can't offer any information but the mice do seem to be very sensitive and responsive. I did experience some frustrating lag with the mouse for a time but changing the receiver dongle to a USB 3.0 port took care of the problem. It wasn't caused by the mouse. I still don't understand why a USB port suddenly gets weird and slow but it does happen with some computers. We run older desktop tower computers with Linux systems so the occasional issues could be either the hardware or caused by some random software update. Switching ports seems to take care of the problem."", ""The mouse is very comfortable for my large hands, and I love the fact that it's wireless. I don't know about the battery life, I just received it. It's also great that it's silent rather that the annoying clicking noise. Overall it's very smooth, comfortable, and looks great along with my video editing equipment."", ""I love this mouse, BUT the scroll wheel does not last. I have had one of these for years and I always love it. It fits my hand ergonomically, I love the quiet click, it is small so easily portable. However, it is frustrating that eventually the scroll wheel just stops working. When I scroll down, sometimes the screen goes up, sometimes it will jump down, sometimes back and forth. In the grand scheme I love everything else about it, but I wish that the scroll wheel was more durable. I do not use it every day, it is my personal mouse not used for work so I'd like it to be more durable. It would also be great to have a bluetooth version, but the usb dongle is pretty small so not super intrusive."", 'The clicks are so satisfying and silent. The clicks feel like pushing down a keyboard rather than clicking.\nBest use for office because you can barely hear the clicks.', 'The mouse clicking is SO quiet. I didn’t expect it to work as well as it does. The quality of the mouse itself is also fantastic and aside from the quietness, this is also one of the best mice I’ve ever used. Very comfortable, quiet, and sturdy.', 'I got a hand me down wireless mouse and it worked well but was quite loud. After reading many reviews, I decided on this mouse - it was a little over my price range for a mouse but thought I’d see if the hype about it is true. Yup, the hype is true. It’s really quiet, responsive, and comfortable.\nThis is my first Logitech purchase and I’m extremely pleased. Thinking about buying a Logitech silent wireless keyboard next.', 'If you are looking for a silent mouse that does not stand out from the crowd, that feels great to the touch, are right-handed, and do not mind to pay a little bit more, then look no further, because this is the mouse for you. Haha, it may sound like I am advertising, but I\'m really not. It\'s just an overall a good mouse.\n\nHowever, do note a few cons before purchasing the product:\n- Only has 3 buttons (left-click, right-click, and a scroller): nothing else fancy\n- Might be a little on the small side of sizes when it comes to big hands (might lean towards a ""claw grip"" for comfortable usage\n\nThe rest, whatever you can think of a good mouse, is all there as pros for this Logitech mouse:\n- Great ergonomic (especially for right-hand users)\n- Very smooth tracking\n- Even though people mention the mouse sleeps, it does great tracking and wakes up like it wasn\'t even asleep in the first place (does not lag)\n- Compact and sturdy, while being lightweight\n- Great for long-term usage\n- Very silent indeed! More silent than how most laptop keyboards sound.\n\nLast but not least, gaming. If you plan to game with this mouse, it\'s doable, but as I have mentioned previously, it may be better to get a gaming mouse for better ergonomic (and full size hands feel). Otherwise, this Logitech mouse does offer great DPI, so gaming is possible (just like any other mouse would do).', 'Na primeira foto, minha experiência como cliente não foi agradável, pois apesar de bem protegido pela embalagem inflável e o mouse estar dentro de um ""saquinho"", não veio ao menos na caixinha e o manual.\nQuando abri, logo pensei em devolver pensando que o produto seria de péssima qualidade.\nPorém comecei a me surpreender aos poucos, pois a aparência do mouse é bonita sim.\nOs desenhos laterais não são exatamente iguais do anúncio, porém é detalhe de baixa relevância e não é emborrachado.

As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset. If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.

My best of which was my trusty Logitech M185.\nHow I loved that mouse. But now i\'ve got a new sweetheart it\'s name is Rival 3.\nIt ""skates"" on my mousepad likglass and is perfect for my smedium hands with claw grip but fingertip would work excellent aswell. Overall give it a try my performance in FPS games is now alot more consistent and for the money can\'t beat it.', 'Bought this one as an ""Amazon\'s Choice"", because it seemed pretty good-looking for the price. Upon getting it plugged in, I discovered that I had to download the company\'s proprietary software to change ANYTHING about the mouse. Annoying, but alright.\n\nIt was a little obtuse to get around, but I only ever wanted to be able to use my middle mouse button to change the light colors, so I can\'t speak for the actual utility.\n\nThen, the software stopped working (Or rather, I think I had to ALWAYS HAVE THE SOFTWARE OPEN in order for any of it to work). Again, obnoxious, but I can live with just setting it to one color. By now, I already didn\'t like it that much, but I figured this was me getting my money\'s worth in the bad way.\n\nThen, the MOUSE stopped working. At random intervals, it would just...stop responding. I would have to reset it in order to make it work again, and doing so would basically force-reset every other device on my USB hub (Keyboard, headset, webcam - as annoying as it sounds).\n\nI started troubleshooting. It wasn\'t the port. It wasn\'t the hub. It wasn\'t the fact that it was IN a hub. It still did this with different keyboards, and with everything else unplugged. It has continued to do this at least once, and usually closer to five times (three or four times while I was writing this review), every day until I finally bother to replace it.\n\nOverall, it just...doesn\'t work. I might\'ve just gotten a faulty mouse, but I\'m mostly just astounded by the fact that it\'s SO bad that it\'s affecting OTHER devices. Just save up some more and spend 40 on a mid-line gaming mouse or something.\n\nTLDR: Moody software, buggy hardware, don\'t bother', 'Its good for people who arent gonna be spam clicking their mouse for 1000000 clicks per second. good for Roblox Fortnite and overwatch.', 'Muy buen mouse, lo recomiendo 100% vale mucho la pena por si precio y calidad 👌', '', 'Een toppertje in zijn categorie!!!', '', 'As a massive Destiny 2 fan, I love buying different kinds of Destiny merchandise.

I will come back and update if I have insightful longer term updates to provide.\n\nBefore jumping into my $.02 I think it\'s useful to prefix review input with past experiences and what I\'m comparing my product against.\nWhen thinking about music and overall sound quality, I have Apple AirPod Max\'s that blow these things out of the water. These can\'t touch the Max\'s bass, nor do they sound as smooth and natural out of the box (as everyone has said, these are quite flat out of the box). I also have SennHeiser MB660s that have been my work conference/music-at-the-desk and occasionally my gaming headphones w/o a mic and even they sound far, far better for music and even in some games (assuming OOB setup, not fully configured with Sonar).\n\nI am also going to address the lack of ANC outside of the pros/cons list, because I think the use cases of this headset are unique compared to general over the hear headphones. Despite my opinion, I do think it\'s odd the wireless version of these have ANC and these don\'t. However, I think if you want pure, fairly competitive or natural and detailed game sound quality above all else, you do not want ANC hissing and adding pressure to your ear. If you haven\'t owned in or over ear headphones with ANC you might not realize that the constant pressure they create on your ears cancelling out noise will fatigue your ears for long gaming sessions. I also don\'t think when I need to hear footsteps exactly where they are around me and where they\'re going in Warzone that I want to try to separate ANC hiss from game noise. I guess this could be easily addressed by putting the feature in the headphones and letting the game profile turn it on off.\n\nPROS:\n- the sound profile is very flat out of the box. I think that opens the most options wit the Sonar EQ software to adjust them to more peoples preferences.\n- if you read this and are a gamer who plays games that has voice chat, I totally under-estimated and under-valued what the GameDac can do. The GG software splits up game sound, your game mic, and your game chat mix into 3 individual audio streams. The best part of this, is games like Warzone let you split which audio device the game uses for those audio outputs. You can then press the dial on the dac once and adjust the output between chat and game sound. This means I can dynamically adjust hearing my team or the game - if people have low mics, are mumbling, or are obnoxious children blaring music into their mic during the game I can curtail that instantaneously.\n- despite no ANC the ear cushions do a really good job of blocking out most sound\n- I think the ear muffs and head band could be more comfortable than my Sennheisers and AirPod Maxes. These things just disappear on my head. I have never gamed more than an hour and a half straight without taking them off, but I thought nothing of them being on my head for that long.\n- the mic is excellent, especially with the ClearVoice ""AI"" filter\n- the game presets are pretty good out of the box. the sound quality and clarity are excellent. despite lacking in music impact, I have to admit these are probably are setup as they should to give the most accurate, clear in game sound. the sound imaging to pinpoint players is spot on, the volume levels are good. I cannot take these more than 75% in war zone without hurting my ears.\n\nCONS:\n- the Sonar software component of the GG suite requires a SteelSeries account to enable. This is totally unacceptable and just shows where SteelSeries is trying to monetize by getting your e-mail address. I have never found an aspect of Sonar that requires SteelSeries knowing who I am or utilizing an account to manage or enable my product.\n- I don\'t think if you\'re an audio snob you\'ll have a jack of all trades headset. as I mentioned above I have at least 2 over ear headphones that aren\'t even in the same solar system for music\n- stop buying the hype about the marginal better sound quality from the DAC. 99/100 normal people with untrained ears with average hearing can\'t tell the difference between compressed bluetooth audio and lossless wired headphones, all else equal. I bought the wired because I have so many bluetooth or wireless devices in my headset that when I want to game, I do not want interruptions, drop outs, hitches or blips.', 'Short version: It’s a really good headset on its own but once you combine it with the GameDAC the customization it allows is something everyone should spend a little time to learn to personalize it best.\n\nLong version: Everything about this headset goes above and beyond. As long as you know the basics in your audio settings it’s as simple as plug and play. Though combine that with their steel series software (which btw compared to the software of other brands like razor for example, steel series software barely touches any resources and will not be a hindrance to have running in the background.) The pads around the ears are soft and very comfortable allowing for wearing as long as you’d like. At no point is there ever really discomfort. The GameDAC with the software makes it easy to control your volume using the smooth to the touch dial and a very simple interface that is easy to understand with a useful little tutorial on how to use it. This overall should be good enough for the general consumer to get their hands on this thing but for audiophiles, they get to have their cake and eat it too! The software allows you to play with an equalizer in the software that also has the audio split between several categories (Game, Chat, Media, Aux, and Mic). So you can set your Game channel to allow you to gain the advantage in your game or allow you to have a more immersive experience. Along side that you can have the Media channel to make whatever you watch or listen to sound as crisp as possible allowing you to enjoy every little detail to your favorite songs and movies.\n\nOverall phenomenal product and I recommended it for anyone looking for a quality headset without shelling out $500+ one some “super duper high quality headset” when for this price gets ya right up there for a fraction of the cost.', ""The left ear did not work when it came out of the box also I got mine from Best buy just to get it the same day cuz I'm impatient. When I was comparing apples to apples the dial on the one from Amazon did not feel completely smooth it felt almost as if there was small piece of stuck in there kind of similar to how the dial feels after years of use. The one from Best buy that was not defective was super duper smooth when turning the knob.. obviously it'll be different sellers that you're buying it from but just know that the dial should be super smooth you should feel absolutely no obstruction and the headset is very loud if it's not very loud it's defective.

Logitech G903,"Logitech G903 LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse W/ Hero 25K Sensor, PowerPlay Compatible, 140+ Hour with Rechargeable Battery and Lightsync RGB, Ambidextrous, 107G+10G optional, 25,600 DPI, Black",Computer Parts,93.90,Amazon,4.6,"['I\'m on my computer for work all day long, so I\'m always on the lookout for great accessories that make my life easier, and this mouse is one of them. It\'s a little pricey, but it\'s very responsive across multiple surfaces and feels great in my hand. That said, I do have a few minor complaints.\n\nFirst of all, I bought the charging pad with my mouse and it worked great for about 6 months. Then I lost the USB dongle in a move so I purchased a replacement mouse, but even though it\'s recognized and shows up in the Logitech G Hub software, the pad have never charged the mouse since and I have no idea why. That said, I can charge the mouse with a USB cable from <15% to 100% in a couple of hours and a full charge last for weeks even with heavy use so it\'s not a huge deal, although it might suggest that the rather expensive charging pad isn\'t really worth the expense.\n\nSecond, there\'s a button next to the mouse wheel that switches the wheel from free spinning to tensioned mode where the mouse will stop moving as soon as you stop pushing it. I like the free spinning mode as it\'s a great way to quickly jump around a long document or web page, but the wheel on this model is very loose and tends to scroll drift the instant you lift your finger off the wheel even if you\'ve stopped the movement several times by gently pressing down on the wheel. I\'ve owned many different mice over the years and this is the first one where the wheel was so loose it would constantly drift like that, and I know it\'s specific to the model because I own 3 of these mice for my various personal and work computers and they all exhibit the same behavior.\n\nFinally, I always reassign one of my mouse buttons to double-click. I\'ve learned over the years that if I physically double-click the little metal tab under the mouse button fatigues in less than a year and starts doing that annoying double-click when you only clicked once thing, so I always assign a button and use that instead. Now, there\'s no problem assigning a button to double-click, the catch is the G Hub software. It has this really obnoxious thing where it auto sleeps after like 5-10 minutes of mouse inactivity, so when you move your mouse again it plays a loud ding and for a couple seconds only basic left click and right click work before G Hub wakes up and pushes the custom button assignments into the mouse again.\n\nI\'ve spoken with tech support at Logitech and there is no way to prevent G Hub from auto sleeping, that\'s just the way the software is designed, but there is a mouse memory mode. Basically, instead of communicating constantly with G Hub, you can just have the mouse ""remember"" its button assignments in a kind of offline mode. So no need for G Hub and no need for that annoying pause every time I move my mouse after reading for a few minutes. Except for some reason double-click is in a category of button assignments that doesn\'t qualify for the mouse memory mode, and according to tech support there\'s no way to get around that, which is kind of a bummer.\n\nAnyway, that\'s about it. I do like the mouse, but there is room for improvement in my book.', ""So far I've had this mouse for 9 days, It's probably about a 9.7 out of 10.\n\nMy main qualms with it:\n-The on and off switch on the bottom is really flat, which makes it hard to flip without pressing any buttons, which is an issue when you put your computer into sleep mode. More of an annoyance than anything though, the switch feels nice, as far as switches go.\n\n-Being that it's ambidextrous, design wise it focuses on symmetry, unfortunately the way they went about it makes the back rather bulbous, which is uncomfortable to rest your palm on, the material, while nice and solid feeling, makes it slick. Overall it feels like it's sliding around in my hand. You kind of have to monkey paw it or rest your wrist/bottom of your palm on a wrist rest to utilize it best.\n\n-The side buttons are nice, they feel great, the buttons are separate, but the flat piece that covers the buttons to make it flush and smooth like the rest of the mouse is only one piece, so you can't have 3 side buttons and a flat fourth, you have to have 4 buttons or 2. or 3 with the fourth one being the open button slot, which isn't the best idea given how dirty mice get. Don't wanna get that stuff inside.\n\nThe pros:\n-long battery life. only charged it once right after I got it 9 days ago, so far it's only down to 84%, which is much longer than the pro wireless one I had before.\n\n-Has the sacred scroll wheel unlock. Literally best mouse feature ever.\n\n-Switch between DPI's quickly\n\n-3 scroll wheel buttons. Down press, left press, right press. Really good design.\n\nOverall I'd say it's worth it. I like it more than the Hero G502 and the G Pro Wireless."", ""I bought this a year ago in the attempt to find a wireless mouse that behaved like a good old fashioned wired mouse.\n\nAll other wireless mice I have tried were very unstable as far as the the pointer lag and intermittent movement goes. There was no way to learn where the pointer would end up as it would move, skip, stop, move again, etc while simply moving the mouse either slowly or quickly. Horrible tracking.\n\nThe only thing that worked accurately was an ancient wired microsoft mouse I had.\nMy mouse 'pad' is the arm of the couch made of a fitted velour type cloth that came with the couch.\nI tried a blue tooth optical mouse, jumpy. Splurged on the flagship model of logitech that tracks on glass, also jumpy. Sent that thing back. Didn't like the strange shape either.\n\nI then tried this one. It uses a different usb dongle which works on a different frequency and higher speed for the radio connection. Success! This mouse tracks very well. No jumping around or skipping of movement at all, just like the wired mouse.\n\nI think it is because it uses 'Light speed wireless' as the connection rather than bluetooth or wifi.\n\nIt has a reputation of bad switches from the other reviews. Only now is it showing some minor signs of the switches being imperfect and that is hardly noticeable so far. I have sourced replacements for them when they do go bad.\n\nBattery life is fairly good. Not nearly as good as the old kind that used 2 AA batteries. Maybe 1-2 months with heavy use and turned on 24/7. Old ones that use AA (blue tooth) last more like a year or more.\n\nThe settings can be stored on the mouse itself so no need to have to have some software running all the time to retain settings. The software it uses is Logitech G Hub. I'm on Win7 and used an older version of that. If I allow it to update itself, it will fail to run on Win7. Once you have setup your switches, LED colors, etc and stored that on the mouse, the Logitech software can be terminated and set to not start as a windows service. I have turned off all the LEDs since the nice lights consume power from the battery.\n\nExcellent mouse overall."", 'Fully programmable, outstanding battery life, attractive design.\n\nHowever, my right hand is very different from my left hand. Few, if any, of the buttons fall naturally under any of my fingers, and some buttons are actually quite awkward. This is not a design-fault since this is an ambidextrous mouse and therefore must be a compromise to some extent. This mouse is very well designed for what it is.\n\nI\'m giving 5 stars since it meets all it\'s design specs - I don\'t think an ambidextrous mouse could be designed better. But next time I will buy a ""handed"" mouse. Your mileage may vary...', 'Lo pedí una vez y le faltó una pieza yo creo que fue un error de empaquetado, pero el mouse se veía excelente, así que lo pedí de nuevo y ahora si venía perfecto, ya lo probé y funciona muyy bien, así que satisfecha con el producto :)', '', 'My old G502 was starting to show trace of it age so I decided to upgrade to a wireless mouse and boy I am satisfied!

Battery life is OK but could be greater,m probably those RGB eating all the power.', 'El mouse entregado es uno claramente usado, y ni si quiera para limpiarlo un poco para entregarlo y fingir que no es así. Lo probaré un poco y si no lo devolveré inmediatamente.', '', 'G-series mice are generally small. The G502, G604 right-handed ""ergonomic"" designs leave a void in the ball of the thumb. It\'s too narrow, especially if held with ring finger on right-click, middle finger on scroll wheel(aka 1-3-1 grip). If you use 1-3-1 grip, ambidextrous mouse fits best.\n\nG903 fits well. The hard side surfaces on G903 has an advantage over typical soft rubber/silicone sides because it\'s resistant to pinkie finger nails digging a crater in the soft material over time. I prefer the hard, easy to clean surfaces\n\nThere are enough reviews about the double-click issue for me to expect a button replacement down the road. Quality control isn\'t good enough at this price.\n\nEDIT:\nAs expected, left switch died, not responding; I replaced both switches. Have since used many other models(mostly razers) and I\'m increasing my rating from 4 to 5 stars. This is still one of my favourites, because of it\'s mix of gaming and productivity features; Gaming mouse with a hyperscroll wheel is rare.\n\nG903 is similar to G Pro, except g-pro lighter, caters to gaming no hyperscroll.\n\nIt\'s shape would be better with higher mid section. Add optical switches, AA battery option, bluetooth, usb-c usb dongle holder, and it would be perfect!']","3,670"

I’ll be Frank, the screen is amazing. 2k is giving me amazing frame rates on all the major games and the clarity, frame rate is night and day difference. I am playing modern warfare 2- war zone on ps5 with superb vision and responsiveness. Along with a lot of other demanding games. I have no complaints for this price point and really recommend it as honestly with 4K on a ps5 the best you’re gonna get is 60 hz and that juice isn’t worth the squeeze.

This screen does work great with the ps5 just make sure you get a good hdmi 2.0 cable for it and enjoy. You’re really not gonna be disappointed with this screen from LG.

It is designed to provide optimal heat transfer from the processor or graphics card to the heatsink, which helps to keep the components cool even under heavy loads. This is especially important for gamers and other power users who demand the highest levels of performance from their systems.\n\nAnother great feature of the ARCTIC MX-4 is its long durability. Unlike some other thermal pastes that tend to dry out and lose effectiveness over time, the MX-4 is designed to last for years without any degradation in performance. This means that you won't have to worry about replacing the thermal paste on your CPU or GPU for quite some time.\n\nIn terms of safety, the ARCTIC MX-4 is an excellent choice. It is non-conductive and non-capacitive, which means that it won't cause any damage to your components if it comes into contact with them. Additionally, it is very easy to apply, thanks to its non-viscous consistency, which makes it spread easily and evenly.\n\nOverall, I have been extremely happy with my purchase of the ARCTIC MX-4 Premium Performance Thermal Paste.

The 4070Ti was the best price/performance/power consumption ratio by far, so much so that it was a no brainer for me to settle for it over the 4090. I'm keeping this review shorter than I normally would, since even though I'm an expert at this point I think im just gonna give the main points here and not get overly specific.\n\n1)To be competetive in the new AI machine learning world nvidia has a distinct advantage, I'm glad im not struggling with a higher specced AMD card without the damn drivers to give me all the massive speed and efficiency increases that these NVIDIA drivers give me, period. Sry I love AMD too and my chip is nothing other than the meaty and equally mighty Threadripper, but Iove and need are two different things and I need performance and compatibility guaranteed out of anything I pay 800 bucks for.\n\n2)Since I'm developing AI based products my mileage will vary from anyone buying this to play a videogame with, all I can say is I wish i had 800 bucks to waste on videogames lol. I'm sure the card is a beast on videogames too but i honestly just wouldn't know, I did a vanity benchmark on some free new TombRaider game that I'll never play and was pleased that the fps was through the roof at highest settings and stopped to reminisce an actually play in some ultrasmooth Borderlands before I got back to work.\n\n3)The price :(\n\n4)Amazon extended me some credit to buy it over a few payments, so these past four months have been the most productive months in my company's history due to being able to afford this equipment that has been performing solidly and reliably nonstop almost 24/7 since purchase.\n\n5)Finally, the 1800 dollar question. Do I regret, after 4 months buying this unit over the 4900? The honest answer is this: Yes, but hell no. Yes, If I had a card twice as fast as this one I wouldn't burst into tears of sadness. But no, I would burst into tears of sadness if it cost me my only remaining kidney what am I supposed to pee with NVIDIA and AMD? Does the 4900 come with a mechanical kidney or at least a promo code towards one instead of FIFA 2026? If so then ok I wish I would've bought the 4900 even thought it would have cost twice the power to use 24/7, so my power company will be twice as happy. I honestly dont know, if I have more customers then the 4090 may become a necessity, but I'm not looking forward to it.\n\n6)There u have it, I hope even though it only covered the basics, like yes if you get it for machine learning you will be very glad you did and have a card that is more than capable of cranking out professional production level product with efficiency, speed, power savings, economical, plug and play compatibility with every thing type of performance. you're welcome.
