"AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core, 12-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor with Wraith Stealth Cooler",Computer Parts,79.00,Amazon,4.8 out of 5 stars,"['The AMD Ryzen 5 3600 is a game-changer! From seamless gaming to smooth content creation, this CPU delivers top-notch performance without breaking the bank. Easy installation, exceptional multitasking, and unbeatable value make it a must-have for any PC enthusiast. Highly recommended!', 'I have been using this for years now, it still works very well. Great for my budget build', 'Have had this product for two years and have not been disappointed! Easily handles video editing and processing on my Pinnacle Studio 26 software. Price of purchase fit my budget when I built my PC for medium level video editing and processing. Quickly deals with EXCEL spreadsheets for over 3000 entries and PowerPoint slide presentations with audio and video.', ""AMD has really done a great job in catching up and overtaking Intel. The Ryzen 5 3600 was, hands-down, the best budget CPU when I purchased it in 2020. For $200, this thing is an absolute powerhouse. This CPU will easily handle ANY games you throw at it, and can even stream at the same time without maxing out (at least from my experience). It ranks VERY well against its contemporaries (as long as you don't use UserBenchmark).\n\nIt does run a bit hot, but the Wraith cooler that comes with it is enough to keep thermals within comfortable ranges. I use a 120mm AIO (which isn't the best CPU cooling method) and I rarely hit temperatures that exceed 75 while gaming.\n\nOne thing I should definitely say now, in the era of Intel 11th-gen and AMD Ryzen 5000, this CPU is not worth it at prices above $200. The i5-10400 is running at $150-175. It may not be as good as the 3600, but it still is a good CPU and is much more affordable. Seeing this listing here that has the CPU at $240 is not good considering that we are in the era of Ryzen 5000 and Intel-11, AND Intel is tanking the prices of its 10th-generation processors.\n\nI am AMD all the way, but if AMD still wants to out-compete Intel in previous-generation sales, they will have to get competitive in the price area. If they do, then this CPU will definitely be a no-brainer buy for a budget builder since this CPU is still more than viable now.\n\nTL;DR - Worth it for $200 in 2020, not worth $240 in 2021 with the existence of Ryzen 5000 and Intel 11th-Gen. Still a very capable GPU for gamers. Would be more than worth it if price dropped to around $175."", 'Works good', ""Came in perfectly fine, didn't have a single issue with it besides the fact that the thermal paste wasn't pre applied so make sure you have some just in case. The graphics are very good, it's smooth in games, boots up like it should. This is definitely worth it's price. The spire cooler is bigger than the stealth so be sure to do some research on which would fit in your PC or perform better."", 'Installed on a fresh build 4/16/24.\n\nThis processor is great for an entry-level or budget build. It’s a great value that really puts in a lot of work on only 6 cores.\n\nInstall was easy, and it booted up no problem. I have not tracked specific temperatures, but this build doesn’t really require anything too strenuous.\n\nTwo demerits contributed to the missing star.\n1: The packaging was a bit weak. Plastic molds meant to hold the fan and cpu were broken and gave me cause for concern. (After inspection, I found all was well, but it’s never fun to hear a computer part rattle in the box.)\n2: The fan comes with past already applied. I like that this inclusion makes the cpu immediately install-ready; however, the paste looks a bit dried out. I would prefer the paste to be included in tube form in the box. Putting on fresh paste makes me feel a whole lot better.', 'THis was bought to update an older am4 motherboard. This is a tried and true cpu chip. If i didnt have a newer ryzen 5000 chip this would be my go to for my childs build.', 'Al dia de escribir esta reseña ya hay mejores procesadores que este, pero en su momento fue uno de los mejores procesadores calidad-precio', '', ""Performs well for a 1080p gaming build, or for casual use. Even able to play a lot of the newer titles if paired with the right GPU. While there are certainly more powerful processors out there, this is a great buy for someone wanting to dip their toes into the PC space without too much of an investment. Even comes with its own cooler, which I'd recommend upgrading if possible, but it does the job."", 'Great processor for the price. Performance is strong and it keeps up with modern games, temperatures are never an issue either.', 'o processador chegou em perfeito estado, todos os pinos retos, e funcionando perfeitamente, já testei em alguns jogos, e já percebo uma diferença. estou agora escrevendo esse post com o próprio PC com o processador. o produto é tal como prometido, e uma nota interessante é que o cooler já veio com uma pasta térmica aplicada, então foi extremamente fácil de instalar.', '', 'Perfect for my daughter to play Fortnite with.

Highly recommended!"", 'For 6 years, my CPU was a Ryzen 5 1600X. It still did pretty decently, but needless to say, I needed to upgrade badly.\n\nThe Ryzen 5 5600X is definitely what I needed. It runs way hotter than the 1600X though. Temps are usually in the 40s at idle and reaching up to 81c so far when I game.\nAt first, I thought I had caused this by messing up with the thermal paste. I had a lot of difficulty screwing in the fan and I had to slide it around to get it in the right spots, so I got scared that I scraped off some paste in the process.\n\nTurns out, It\'s......... just a very hot CPU. This is common. You can safely go to 95c.\n\nI read that there\'s a setting called ""Precision Boost Overdrive"" that basically runs an overclock automatically and that turning it off in BIOS will help lower the temps. I haven\'t done that yet, but I may if temps go higher.\n\nAll the games I\'ve thrown at it run much better with no issues. Videos render much quicker too.

"AMD Ryzen 5 3600X 6-Core, 12-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor with Wraith Spire Cooler",Computer Parts,199.00,Amazon,4.8 out of 5 stars,"['This CPU is amazing. It is great at everything. It can game, multitask, stream, productivity, and more. It’s priced good enough that even if you just want it for general computing it’s still great. This thing comes pushed to the limit straight out of the box pretty much. Traditionally I overclock every CPU I buy but with this one AMD have pretty much pushed them to the max for us. Which is great because it’s plug n play! Mine with PBO and Thermal Limits set to max stays around 4.250ghz on all cores gaming under full load with 1 of the 6 cores boosting to 4.35-4.15ghz. So in a game 5 cores will be at 4.250 ghz and one core will always be around 4.35-4.15ghz with that 1 core alternating so they take turns. This gives great ipc and single threaded performance as well as multithreaded. This gives high FPS in games due to the strong single core performance than a 4.3ghz all core overclock gets. You can basically set PBO to max and TBU to max and your motherboard and system will boost it as high as it can. It’s amazing it’s literally drop it in and your good to go this time around. No overclocking needed. I have this CPU in the Asus Prime X570-Pro motherboard if anyone was curious. It was 260 dollar board so it’s pretty nice imo. So your numbers may be different than mine. For cooling I’m using a simple Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo in Push/Pull with twin fans. Keeps my CPU in the mid 30sC idle, in the 50sC in gaming rather it’s an hour or all day long. Under Prime 95 stress test it topped out at 76C then dropped back to 74C and stayed there. For a 35 dollar cooler pretty insane. I have great case air flow so if you do not do not expect these results. The best way to get more performance from your Ryzen CPU since it’s basically pushed to the max out of the box is via memory. You can look it up if you wish. Memory speed significantly effects your cpus performance at least in gaming. It was shown going from 2666mhz to 3600mhz memory speed in games was giving huge FPS increases. In almost all games 10-20 FPS increase with some games increasing as much as 30-40fps. So if you buy a Ryzen CPU for the love of god buy 3600mhz memory with it. I have 32GB of G.Skill Ripjaws in mine all running at 3600mhz and that’s using all 4 dimm slots 4x8GB sticks in duel channel mode. Fast memory paired with this CPU in a good motherboard means you don’t have to overclock or touch anything this time around and you get amazing performance in all regards. I have my 3600x and 3600mhz memory paired with a RTX 2070 Super that is overclocked really well and I am playing any games I want at 1440P maxed out getting 100+ FPS in pretty much everything. If you want a nice CPU for gaming, streaming, content creation, or anything else well you’re looking at one. At this point in time the Ryzen 3600XT is out now which is basically this exact CPU except it runs around 4.6ghz in the boosting alternative core and probably around 4.4 on the other 5 core. So you gain roughly about 200mhz over this 3600x by going with the XT. Rather that’s worth it well that’s up to you. At most the difference in FPS between the two might be 5 FPS at max. So just get whichever is the best deal. Even the Ryzen 3600 non X or non XT does very very similar in performance to the X and XT and is 150 dollars right now. Everything I said pretty much applies to all 3 CPUs they are just an amazing gaming chip.', 'Got it for 90 bucks....well worth the upgrade since when I built my Ryzen PC, I went super cheap on the CPU just to get a better GPU....now that I got this Ryzen 5 3600x to go with my RX 5700xt...the GPU is now the bottle neck instead of the CPU. Great for workstation and better then expected for gaming. Best CPU for the money IMO. Reminds me of the old FX days when everyone said they were low tier...but in my experience, they preform so much better then intel when it comes to cost/performance. Is it the fastest ever made? Of course not...it was 90$!', ""I will admit, I was hesitant to buy an AMD CPU. The benchmarks put it competing with Intel CPUs that cost nearly twice as much, so even though I've used Intel since my very first build I decided to try it out. And this CPU cannot be beat for the price. If you are planning on buying a CPU for a gaming rig, BUY THIS CPU. It blows the tits clean off any other Intel core at this price point, and every game I have thrown at it hits the 144 FPS mark. Before I upgraded (admittedly I was due for an upgrade, I'd been abusing the crap out of my i5 4690k with ridiculous overclocks) I had trouble reaching that 144fps on a couple games, namely warframe, GTA5, and Monster Hunter World. After this CPU, they all hit that cap across the board.\n\nPower consumption is relatively low for how much work it does, and the boost clock has run for about 2 weeks now without any instability or crashing.\n\nThe only thing you should look at is buying a better heat sink. While the one they include is certainly better than any stock heat sink I've ever used, testing Monster Hunter World for an hour got the temps up to 78° at max with it installed, usually hovering around the high 60s. While that's still technically a safe temperature... it's still a bit high for my tastes, especially since I'm tired of constantly keeping an eye on coretemp. Plus, the fan isn't the quietest thing in the world, and the settings I used had the fan hit full power at 67° which meant it was almost always running at full whack. So I threw an old coolermaster on and the same tests maxed out at 69° averaging about 60°, which is much better.\n\nMy mantra used to be Intel for CPUs and AMD for GPUs, but I'm an AMD man across the board now. I planned on buying the i9 9900k, but a friend told me to look into this CPU instead. I think I owe my friend a drink or two now since he saved me $200+!\n\nBear in mind, the computer I use this on is used almost exclusively for gaming. The fact that this CPU is only 6 cores for a newer model makes me think it was specifically designed with gaming in mind. I cannot speak for other applications that are CPU intensive, especially those that benefit greatly from multiple cores. But for every current gen game, even crappy ports like Monster Hunter, this CPU is top-notch quality for a mainstream price."", 'Esta é a primeira vez que uso um processador da AMD nos meus PCs. Depois de ler muitos reviews e comparativos decidi fazer a experiência e até o momento tudo está 100%. O principal fator que me fez optar pelo AMD Ryzen 5 3600X foi não só a sua performance, superior ao Intel Core i5-9600K, mas também a compatibilidade com as novas arquiteturas recém lançadas pela AMD. No caso da Intel, houve mudanças de socket depois da nona geração o que me colocaria sem possibilidade de upgrade sem a troca também da motherboard.\n\nFazer upgrade de CPU e Motherboard em um computador com o Windows instalado já foi uma enorme dor de cabeça, mas o processo com o Windows 10 foi extremamente tranquilo. Foi só trocar, ligar e o Windows fez (quase) tudo.

One issue that I had though when installing on my Aorus B450 Pro Wifi board is that not all of the included screws were able to reach the intended holes.

She is running this CPU paired with an intel A770 GPU (upgraded from an older RX580). Given the GPUs that were tied to this build so far, the CPU has been handling the gameplay without becoming a bottle neck. It runs with a stock cooler at acceptable temps. All in all, this was a good budget build with good performance with current games (given the display settings we are using).', ""For me CPUs like this, which are budget CPUs are mostly about the price. For $100 USD or less this is an excellent buy. If it's more than that, uhhhh. I'll take the 5600 for $130 Bob.\n\nWhile this is a Zen 3 CPU, it's not PCIe gen4 and you should be aware of this before buying. It's not the same line of CPU that most Zen 3 CPUs which are Vermeer. This is Cezanne. There are 3 Cezanne CPUs, the other two are OEM only, meaning they only come in a PC you buy from a company that makes PCs like Dell, etc........ For the most part this isn't a problem because it's a budget CPU, however if you pair this with something like an AMD Radeon 6500 XT which only uses 4 PCIe lanes to connect to the CPU, you'll get bad performance. So don't do that.\n\nOtherwise as long as you pair this with at least an 8 PCIe lane GPU it works fine. You take a tiny hit in GPU performance but not enough to worry about.\n\nThe bigger hit comes with the NVMe drives, especially in 2023 and going forward. There are now MANY NVMe disks that are a lot faster than 4GB/s, and to give as simple explanation as I can, a PCIe lane is a serial data line. The way a PCIe device/bus works is by grouping a certain amount of lanes so that you get the speed of a single PCIe lane times the number of lanes you have. Any NVMe disk has 4 lanes. It also means the port you plug it into along with what it connects to (CPU, motherboard chipset) has 4 PCIe lanes that it will connect with. So, you get 4 PCIe lanes. So now you need to know the data speed for each lane. For PCIe gen3, the speed of each lane is 1GB/s. For PCIe gen4 the speed of each lane is 2GB/s. So, with this CPU, the best you can get is a data transfer rate of 4GB/s to an NVMe disk. That's it. The newest disks coming out the end of 2022, and 2023 can hit speeds near 9GB/s. Now, most data transfers to/from NVMe disks can't run at that speed. However many disks can run many data transfers faster than 4GB/s, so that means a CPU that runs PCIe gen3 is slowing down modern NVMe disks that can run gen4 or now gen5 speeds. But that's not a statement that has a clear meaning, because just because a disk is called gen4, it doesn't mean most of the data transfers to/from that disk will run at the full bandwidth of PCIe gen4 x4 lanes = 8GB/s. Most gen4 disks rarely hit that speed if ever. Only the most expensive ones do. BUT once again many will run different types of transfers above 4GB/s.\n\nSo that's the description of what it means to have PCIe gen3 when dealing with modern NVMe disks. You're going to slow down some of the data transfers, not all, depending on how fast (which also means more expensive) the disk is.\n\nYes for a general purpose PC build this is good enough and it's a low cost option that's really good at $100 USD or less. However if the price of this starts to get closer to the Ryzen 5600, I'd rather buy the 5600 because that's PCIe gen4 which is as good as it gets with an AMD AM4 motherboard."", ""I got this looking for something to match my RX 580 but also give me options for future upgrades and boy was this a good choice.

I have no issues.', ""I found myself in need of upgrading a Core i5 2500K to allow my daughter to play Fortnite with my son and I. I paired this Ryzen 5 4500 with a Gigabyte B450M DS3H WIFI board and 16GB of TForce DDR4, and completed the build with an Antec 520W power supply, a 500GB SSD, and a Radeon RX 6600 that I had sitting in the parts bin.\n\nI already had Windows 11 installed on the drive and it booted right up. I installed the appropriate drivers and then used CPU-z to run a stress test. Under 100% load using the included Wraith Stealth cooler, the max temp I saw was 85C. Since I run a Ryzen 9 7900x on my main rig, I am more than comfortable with Ryzen's ability to handle heat, and 85C is perfectly acceptable in my book. Despite running hot, the fan was nice and quiet the entire time. This was under stock settings - no tuning to the fan curve. During the stress test, the max wattage use by the CPU was right around 58. Right now while idling it is pulling 10 watts and sitting at 40C.\n\nThe only game I have installed right now is Fortnite. On Epic presets, 1080p, using the RX 6600, I was getting 40-55 FPS (which I consider perfectly playable on a budget-level system). On High presets I consistently pulled 60-70 FPS. I would get a little stuttering here and there, which I suspect is memory-bandwidth-related. In all fairness I haven't even opened the BIOS to tune any settings. GPU usage was at 100% and CPU was at maybe 75%-80%. I consider that a pretty efficient pairing, though you could possibly bump up to something like a 6750 XT to get a little more performance without the CPU becoming a bottleneck. In any case, this is sufficient performance for 1080p gaming on most modern titles running at higher settings (without raytracing of course). I'll be doing some additional benchmarks as I finish up the 100+GB downloads, and if there are any changes to my opinion I'll update this review.\n\nThere are definitely faster processors, some of which don't cost a whole lot more than this.

However, despite the lower TDP, the 7600X can still get fairly hot, as I still found that my AIO wouldn't stop it from still reaching the lower 80's in more demanding titles.\n\nOne major thing to note about the 7600X (or all AM5 processors in general) is that due to the new heat spreader design, you will need to make sure that you use a compatible cooler that uses a mounting system that will still apply adequate pressure, and also to be careful if you ever need to remove the CPU as it is harder to grip it by the sides. It's also very easy for thermal paste to fall into the grooves of the new IHS, but this won't be an issue as long as you steer clear of metal-based thermal solutions (unless you know what you're doing.)\n\nOverall, the Ryzen 5 7600X is the best value bargain deal in terms of ALL CPUs on the market right now- regardless if you prefer AMD or Intel. There is simply no CPU with as much performance, versatility, and general range of use in terms of its cost. Additionally, the periodic sales make it even more of a value deal, and I would definitely suggest getting the 7600X over all the other options if all you primarily do is streaming, gaming, or general use.

If you are gaming under 144hz and on a budget this is easily one of the best you can get from this generation.\n\nThis is continually one of, if not the highest, value cpu's as it comes with a very beefy performance for its cost and a cooler all in one package.\n\nI had near-flawless performance when used on my 144hz 1440p monitor in most of my games.

Went to the drawing board and did more tinkering and decided it had to be the cpu as said above. It's a very good cpu, but not entirely sure on quality, could've just been bad. Enable ReBar, PBO and XMP and you're good to go. Best paired with an AIO, with the original fan, it hit temps of 86c. Not good for me. AIO got me running 36c average and about 44c active and jumping to 50c occasionally. It hits advertised speeds and runs everything well. However I've noticed my usage does spike pretty high with what I run. So if you're a pretty heavy user, something a bit bigger might be better.\n\nI haven't run into performance issues with any games. At max 70% to 76%. Most times running around 20 to 30%.

"AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 8-core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor",Computer Parts,193.00,Amazon,4.8 out of 5 stars,"['I have had this CPU for around exactly one year now. Normally I do all my tech reviews fairly early but I wanted to really use this chip, overclock it, game, and do lighting editing as well. To start off my full system is a Ryzen 5800X, Asus X570-Pro board, 32GB of 3600mhz G.Skill CL16 memory (4x8GB), EVGA G3 Supernova 850 watt 80+ Gold PSU, EVGA RTX 2070 Super GPU, Cooler Master NR600 Case, Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black Edition CPU cooler. I have two Gen 4 NVMe drives and 4 normal sata SSD drives. My case is filled with all Cooler Master Masterpro ARGB high CFM airflow fans. I’m also using an internal wireless card as well as my particular x570 board doesn’t come with onboard WiFi. My reason for stating all this is the airflow and cooling in my case is exceptional. I have one of the highest airflow cases, with some of the best fans, one of the best CPU coolers, and I’m using Thermal Grizzly Kryonaunt paste which is hands down the best CPU test for overclocking and temps in general imo. Stating all this because YOUR temps may be different than mine as well as your results. To start of with the chip I’ve not had ONE single issue with it so far after a year of use. ALL I have done to it after installing it in place of the Ryzen 3600 that it replaced was I enabled DOCP on my memory which is AMDs version of XMP and I enabled PBO on my chip with the max limit set at 200mhz. That it all I touched. This chip boosts to 5.1ghz when using 2-3 cores or less easily and even if under full load will still stay around 4.75ghz on all 8 cores at 100% load. In a more realistic load like gaming it runs around 4.75-4.95ghz. Under full load like Prime95 my temps top out around 74C. Idle is around low 30s and while gaming it bounces around 55-65C. It runs super fast and super cool. This is all on air cooling too. When going from the 3600 to the 5800X while every single other aspect of my system remained the same I gained anywhere from 10 fps to over 20 fps on some games. I play at 1440P as well. If you play at 1080P your results will be even better. This is the best chip I’ve ever used and owned. My RTX 2070 Super is overclocked 1100mhz on the memory and 140mhz on the core. On benchmarks my scores beat all stock and even factory OC 2080 Supers. They also beat almost all RTX 3060 ti results as well. I’ve never played a single game where this chip bottlenecks my card ever. Whereas with the 3600 it did from time to time. Especially in games using DLSS which renders the game at a much lower resolution then upscales it. That makes the game way more CPU demanding and in titles with DLSS my fps increase was huge. Absolutely amazing cpu for gaming and you don’t have to do anything other than enable PBO. Gone are the days of manual overclocking to get all the performance you paid for. The chips auto boost themselfs as high as they can go basically all by themselves now. If you have any Zen + or Zen 2 chip and wanna upgrade to Zen 3 aka Ryzen 5000 I say it’s well worth it for gaming. The IPC increase on Ryzen 5000 over 3000 series is huge. Over 30% faster. I’ve included pictures of my setup, CPUz info, benchmark results, MSI Afterburner temperature info after playing Witcher 3 at 1440P on Ultra settings for hours, and many other others. The chip boosts high, runs cool, requires basically no knowledge to get max performance from it outside of TWO toggles in the bios, and at its current price is an amazing value imo. Fast enough to pair any GPU on the market with it if you can find one. I’ve been wanting a 3080 forever now but just no luck. I paid the MSRP of 450 for this chip and don’t regret it at all. No crashes, no issues ever, never breaks 70C while daily use/gaming no matter how long, boosts over 5ghz, and has enough cores/threads if you wanna stream and multitask while gaming you’re good to go. I think AMD did an amazing job with Zen 3 and if you’re interested in the 5800X for gaming/streaming you won’t go wrong. Hope this review helped and if it does please leave a like. Enjoy the pics and thanks for reading.', 'It\'s hard to believe that just 5 years ago an 8 core 16 thread CPU cost well over $100 USD and now the 2700 can be found for $150 (as is could for the last two years) while the 3700X for $279.99 is quite a bargain as well. So is the 5800X worth 33% of a 2016 8/16 from Intel? Or 50% more than a 3700X? 250% more than a 2700?!? That\'s actually a tough call, so I\'ll go with a *maybe.* If you already have a 2700 and game, 4k and don\'t rely too heavily on Photoshop or rendering scenes/videos, then no, I don\'t think it is. If you have a 3700X or 9900/K or better that turns into a hard no unless you really need those extra few minutes it will save you rendering over the course of a day (if that). Now if you have a 2700X or lower and play games at something =/<1440p then you may certainly want to consider it.\n\nBesides noticing an immediate difference in little things, like how quick the mouse is on my desktop compared to a 2700, my in-game FPS is up roughly 10% @1440p with a paltry XFX 5700 non-XT. I definitely didn\'t expect that much of a difference, but since I still plan on upgrading my GPU, most likely in late August or September when the lower prices in the East start making their way to the Western markets, I thought ""Why not, you\'ll just end up spending the extra money on something silly, and you\'ve been squirreling money away since the launch of the 6800/XT and 6900XT\'s were released. By the time I settled on what GPU I wanted and would benefit me most when I work from home, the prices were so silly I didn\'t want to contribute to an unhealthy consumer market considering I have another PC I use for 85% of my work. To my surprise, it did help my GPU out quite a bit more than expected, while greatly improving efficiency in CAD.\n\nWhile the gaming performance is great, and I don\'t anticipate hitting any bottlenecks with the 6800XT or 3080Ti (the 3080 would be a fantastic match for gaming and home office work *if* it wasn\'t so RAM starved, which I see being a big problem within the next couple of years; what was Nvidia thinking? Bleh, giving it the same amount of RAM as mid-range cards from 2016?). The chip itself burns through most workstation tasks faster than any other 8/16 I have ever used. At stock speeds it sips power, runs very cool (I\'m using the stock Wraith Prism that came with the 65 Watt 2700) even when gaming, while having no problem keeping it\'s 4.7 boost for as long as needed. In CPU intensive games like Cyberpunk 2077, Bannerlord or Red Dead Redemption 2 the chip laughs as it might hit 78c and continues to jog along at 4.7, without missing a beat until the action slows down. Baldur\'s Gate 3 is also a joy to play over the 2700 in battles since it runs through so many different scenarios and variables with every NPC before taking that character\'s action for the round. 7-10 seconds per NPC has turned into 1-2, which is fantastic when you have 30 bad guys on the field.\n\nThat said, it is a pretty good value for the money if you are upgrading a pre-2017 system or a 6/12 or lower thread count CPU. If you\'re building a mid-range to high-end gaming PC it\'s fantastic, and is a great option for a home workstation. I could even see running a virtual machine or two with it in a pinch.

Incredible upgrade for the price, especially in games that are hard on the CPU. My only recommendation is that you get a quality cooler for it because it can get hot.', 'Was planning on getting the 5800x3d but then I read that they will be releasing this, which is worth the money and a great upgrade from my old Ryan 5 5500, I get a huge boost in fps on games like valorant, fortnite, etc. and it gives a great boost on demanding games like squad, dcs, etc.', 'My 5700X3D greatly improved performance across the board from my previous 3600, and nears 5800X3D performance at a significant reduction in price. I was also able to undervolt it to reduce operating temp, and the chip has been perfectly stable. Very happy with this chip bringing new life to my older AM4 system!', 'I\'ve got a near 8 year old system that was still running a Ryzen 1700 and GTX 1080, on an MSI B350m Mortar motherboard. The first gen Ryzen had some issue with utilizing 3200mhz ram, I think the official max supported was like 2677mhz, so my RAM was always underclocked. Naturally after so long I was getting the itch for an upgrade.\n\nI didn\'t want to spend $1000 on an AM5 build just for my GPU to be bottlenecked and be forced to buy a $1200-2000 GPU, especially when my GTX 1080 is still surprisingly relevant by today\'s standards.\n\nFortunately my OLD MSI b350m motherboard put out a BIOS update for this processor which literally made it plug and play. Dropped in the new CPU and after taking a little while to boot up, everything ran like normal. After enabling XMP my RAM immediately went to the rated 3200mhz, no fuss, whereas my old Ryzen 1700 would make things very unstable after about 2733mhz.\n\nDepending on your motherboard there\'s some special options in the BIOS you can modify to make the chip run a lot cooler. I am using a 240mm AIO water cooler but the temps were approaching 90C on prime95. I enabled some of the undervolting options and that was making temps top out around 75C while boosting!\n\nI haven\'t had the opportunity yet to thoroughly test it in games yet, but the games I have played so far have been running noticeably better. That is of course on top of the obvious increase in speed in any other task compared to my Ryzen 1700. On top of all this I can consistently push it over 4GHz turbo on 1.15v whereas my 1700 was underclocked to 3.2GHz around 1.2v to be stable.\n\nMy intentions with this processor was to utilize the new 3D Vcache technology to ""future proof"" my AM4 system for at least a few more years to give GPU technology more time to develop and hopefully have some breakthrough where GPUs are better and not so much more expensive nowadays. Beyond the fact the m.2 drives are overkill for most tasks and it\'s still hard to find AM5 motherboards that have USB 4.0 slots.\n\nIn conclusion, this upgrade resulted in my RAM being able to be run at expected speeds or better, a much faster processor and much better gaming performance with lower power draw. It has allowed me to squeeze the last bit of life out of my AM4 board and give it a facelift, for the price of about $300 all in for the CPU, liquid cooler and paste.\n\nIn other words I saved about $1000-3000 in not having to upgrade to the AM5 platform that is still in it\'s infancy, and get to stay on the time tested AM4 platform while the newer platforms work out the kinks and there\'s better GPU options as well as USB 4 standards etc.\n\nIf you\'re on the fence about making the purchase, go for it. I bought this when the price dropped to $229 and at the time that was a $80ish discount from the 5800x3d for a processor that uses a lot less power for maybe a 5% difference in performance. If you care more about your power bill and heat being generated by your computer than a 5% increase in performance, and you\'re staying on the AM4 platform, MAKE THE PURCHASE!', ""Best bang for the buck for the AM4 platform for gaming. Great upgrade from a Ryzen 3 to this processor. Works fantastic in nearly all the games I play and is a steal at the price. If you want more productivity focused of a processor go with a Ryzen 7 5800X instead but for gaming this is where it's at."", ""IF you still on am4 its a no brainer its cheaper than the 5800x3d too and the 5700x3d does run a good bit cooler too :)\n\nIm running a gigabyte 370 k7 MB so i did squeeze some out of it sense mb has a external clock gen and so far its been stable sense i got it little over 2 weeks ago.\n\nNow if you running over 2560x1440p you not going too see huge gains from the 3d cache sense you more so gpu bound over that point. Tho i am running a samsung g9 5120x1440p with a 7900xtx and i do noticed small gains more so depends on the game too but were i noticed the big difference is in the 1% lows and min fps in my case. I also came from a 5800x YES i know .. but more so i needed too rma that cpu and needed another cpu on hand or i would've just been on using the 5800x till i go am5.\n\nOtherwise i been pretty impressed with the 5700x3d ;) Lower clocks it has vs the 5800x3d really aint a big deal either very low percentage between the 2 really."", ""Back in January 2020, I built a gaming PC with a Ryzen 2700X. The CPU served me well, but I did not win the silicon lottery (so ram would not run stable above 2933 MHz) and there was definitely stuttering - especially in the first 5-10 seconds after loading into a new map in a game.\n\nFast forward to April 2024, and I just upgraded the CPU/Cooler, and Case (it was cheaper to get a new case then to replace all of the noisy fans in the old case).\n\nThe first thing I noticed was how much cooler and efficient the 5700X3D runs compared to the 2700X it replaced. I was routinely seeing 58-63C temps (with spikes to 70+C) with the 2700X, and now I am running 40-45C (even sometimes as low as in the high 30C range, and occasionally 46-47C).\n\nSecond thing is the complete absence of stuttering. I never realized how back the stuttering was, I knew it wasn't good, but holy moley - it is soooooo smooth. Also, this CPU seems to sip power, unlike the 2700X, which loved to drink down power.\n\nThird, I am now running ram at an ultra stable 3200 MHz. This computer also is nearly dead silent - other than some minor coil whine from the PSU.\n\nI have seen significantly more stable frame rates (running a game at 120 fps now stays super close to 120 fps vs frequent dips to 60-80 fps. Microstuttering is now almost zero all the time, vs double digits percents all the time, and did I say super silky smooth gaming? Yes, I could have gotten the 5800X3D, but for me, this thing seems to be underutilized now, vs my always stressed out 2700X that was sweating out much higher temps with a nasty stutter at times. I might have built this a bit too quiet or it could be how cool this CPU runs, since instead of deafening fans, I can only barely hear some very muted electrical hisses and whines at times from the UPS severely manhandled PSU, even when gaming hard.

"AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor with Wraith Prism LED Cooler",Computer Parts,199.99,Amazon,4.8 out of 5 stars,"[""Summary:\nIf you want a mid-range machine that's future proof for at least the next few years, this fits the bill nicely. Get a chip that trades blows with an i9-9900K for $200 less and uses less power doing it. Yes, Intel's higher clock speed will allow it to be faster at certain workloads & games, but it's usually not by much. Regarding gaming, if you're running at 1080p or 1440p and not running a top of the line video card, the difference between the 3700x and 9900K is negligible. For workstation use, it's a no brainer, unless you want to up to a 3900x.\n\nBuilding computers and keeping up to date with all the latest hardware is my hobby and second job. I was an AMD guy back in the Athlon XP & Athlon 64 days, but once it was Sandy Bridge vs Buldozer, there was basically no reason to go AMD. For years, I built basically nothing but Intel Machines. Ryzen's intro was exciting to me, AMD is now competitive again! But other than a couple of builds for people, I skipped the first 2 generations. Now, Gen 2 chips are cheap, and Gen 3 chips can not only hold there own, but often outperform Intel in many tasks, sometimes even gaming! And even when they loose, it's not by much.\n\nSo the 3700x gives great performance for the money, but what about stability and easy of setup? Well, it's nearly as good as Intel. Regarding stability, I'd say their fantastic as long as you avoid AMD Video Card drivers, which are a bit flaky at the moment. But with an Nvidia card, rock stable. Now, I said nearly as good as intel due to the drivers, BIOS updates, and power and voltage situation. For most current intel systems, the platform is so mature that everything generally just works out of the box. No drivers or power plans required, Windows 10 knows what to do with the platform. But with AMD Zen 2, there are potential issues on older chip-sets and not being able to boot without BIOS updates, performance issues with older BIOS updates, etc. On top of that, you really want to get the chip-set drivers & power plans to have the best configuration. None of this is hard, but Intel is already so integrated into Windows 10. But with Ryzen gaining market-share at their current pace, integration and optimization will be there soon.\n\nMost of the time, you want to build a balanced system. Here are my CPU suggestions based on price points (Approximations)\n\n$500 to $800 builds: 1600X AF (Which is basically a 2600X)\n$800 to $1300 Builds: 3600\n$1200 to $2500 Builds: 3700X\n$1800 to $3400 Builds: 3900X\n$2500+ Builds: $3950X\n\nMy wife and I rebuild our gaming systems this past Holiday season. Here's my latest rig with this chip:\nProcessor: AMD 3700X\nVideo Card: Nvidia GTX 1070 (used)\nRAM: 32GB G-Skill Dual Channel 3600Mhz CAS16\nMotherboard: MSI X570 Carbon (Good For 3800X and below, VRMs may run hot on 3900X and above)\nSound: Sound Blaster Z\nSSD: 1GB A-DATA SX8200 Pro & 2x 2TB Crucial (1100 & MX500)\nPSU: Seasonic 750W Gold\nCase: Fractal Design Define C\nCPU Cooler: Noctua DH-15\nFans: 4x 140mm Noctua AF-14 & 1x 120mm Noctua AF-12\n\nGaming and productivity have been fantastic with no issues. I really want more GPU power, but I'm waiting for the prices to come down for Nvidia or for AMD to get their driver act together. GTX 1070s can be had for under $200 used, and compare well to GTX 1660 Supers (We got ours before this was an option). If you have the money The 2070 S would be my go to. I could have invested the cost of the expensive fans and CPU cooler to a faster video card or 3900x, but having a system that's quiet, cool, and fast is important to me.\n\nHere's to hoping Ryzen continues down this path!"", 'Good bang for your buck$! This was used for a new PC build, replacing my previous dinosaur which was also a AMD PC built back in Oct 2010. And its still running fine just thought I was overdue for an upgrade. And an Upgrade this is!!\n\nI wasnt much of a gamer before but I do a lot of video editing and processing and this 3700X has GREATLY increased my production wait times! Which freed up lots of time to do other things.\n\nI paired this CPU with a Gigabyte B550 AORUS ELITE V2 , 64GB Crucial Pro RAM, everything has worked great right out of the box. A $500 pc build\nBase clock is 3.6Ghz but during testing, everything set to auto in the bios, Im seeing 4.5~4.8 Ghz regularly on HWmonitor...maybe i won the silicon lottery?\n\nThe Wraith cooler is okay, it keeps things under 80C with fan running at 99%, it never hits 100%. Which i think its usable long term, but there are cheap options out there for air cooling. The cooler you keep things the longer they will last.\n\nOne issue i noticed is the heat from the cooler blows hot air on the ram and video card. Though Im am testing on a bench top, so this might change a little once i place inside my case with exhaust fans.\n\nNice CPU for the $ and its faster than my expectations ever were. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an upgrade.', ""This is by far the best computer processor I have ever used, it is fast and powerful. I have used it for 3D modeling, video editing, and gaming; It has surpassed all my expectations. Although AMD is releasing new processors soon, this model is still very strong and at a great price, which may drop post 5000 release.\n\nThe only problem I had with this processor was not the CPU itself, but the RGB Wraith Cooler. There are so many problems with this cooler that I can't recommend it. Yes, it works and I am in fact still using mine because I didn't budget for one, but I do plan on replacing it soon. Here is everything I found wrong with it:\n\n- It is a pain to install, especially for beginners. Rather than opting for screws or push pins, AMD designed a strange hook mechanism that is absolutely terrible. When installing the cooler, it feels like everything is going to break, and although I know I installed it correctly it didn't feel right.\n\n- It is LOUD! It's not unbearable, but it is annoying. Any time I open up a new app or do something that puts a tiny strain on the CPU, the Wraith speeds up a lot.\n\n- The RGB is a mess! The Prism Wraith has 3 individual RGB lights: the fan, the ring, and the logo. HOWEVER, only the fan can be controlled with external software (AURA SYNC, iCue, etc). If you wish to control all three LEDs, you have to use a separate app from Cooler Master, which requires you to attach a separate cable to one of your internal USB headers. Not to mention, you cannot use the Cooler Master software at the same time as another program, and they are not compatible. So you can either control just the fan LED, or you can control all three with a USB cable and sucky Cooler Master bloatware.\n\n- The cooling isn't very good. At idle it is fine, but gaming or using heavy software it just doesn't keep up very well.\n\nTL:DR - Buy this CPU if you need a good CPU and you don't want to wait for 5000, but budget for a better cooler the Wraith is very disappointing."", 'Muito bom potente ótimo incrível', '', 'Works like a dream', 'La verdad pensaba comprar un Ryzen 9 pero yo mayormente lo uso para juegos ya que tengo otro equipo para trabajar, así que después de evaluar vi que le rendimiento en juegos de este ryzen era realmente muy similar al del Ryzen 9 para la mayoría de los juegos, al menos hasta que salgan juegos que usen mas ""cores"" , así que este cumplía con todo inclusive disipador RGB el cual es muy llamativo, realmente una buena compra, usando la misma tarjeta de video que tenia antes ya regreso a ser un equipo muy competitivo yo juego en 2k de resolución ya que igual el presupuesto para jugar en 4k es mucho mayor, las temperaturas si son un poco elevadas entre 55-60 sin ejecutar nada y como unos 70C jugando, realmente no es nada tan escandaloso para un CPU de estos, además no hay nada de que preocuparse porque si la temperatura aumenta más el ventilador sube la velocidad y lo enfría bien rápido, en resumen no me queda mas que recomendarlos, yo use una placa madre con chispet b550m es una buen combo.\n\ncualquier cosa no duden en preguntar, más tarde adjunto imagenes.', '', 'świetny procesor 8 rdzeni i 16 wątków bardzo przyśpieszyło działanie mojego komputera jak i wydajność w grach nie doświadczam spadków fps w grach takich jak gta 5,wiedżmin 3, na ultra.\n\nW tej cenie to bardzo dobry wybór.', '', ""Purchased on 22nd Oct, assembled myself.\nAm using this system for video editing, gaming (Horizon 4) , and my work which involves big excel files.\nNo regrets yet as it performs as expected, (feels like an overkill sometimes 😋) I tried my max to utilize max juice out of it by coupling right components.\n\nChoice of other components is what decides the performance.

I was able to put the computer together for less than $400 thanks to this APU. I woulnd't recommend this for any serious gaming at 1080+ resolution. Graphics Card prices are low enough now to justify a traditional GPU build. For less intensive use cases, this chip is it. It boosts quite nicely and consitently to 4400mhz and the FSB runs 1:1 with Hynix kit 3600 Cl16 kit I have overclocked to 3733 with tighter timings using Ryzen Dram calculator. Additionally, i used Ryzen Master's Curve Optimizer settings to get even better performance and efficiency. Playing Halo Infinite at 720p lowest settings I'm getting 30-50 fps and with dynamic resolution 60-80fps with the HWmonitor reading 65C. at peak. Not performance i would be satisfied with for competitive play, but that's just not what this APU is for. Using Cinbench R23 this chip will definitely ramp up to 70c. I don't think i've seen it at or near 80c with anything but Prime95 very small fft. The wraith cooler is more than sufficient for this chip.\n\n+Quick and Efficient\n+Low Temps with stock cooler\n+Value\n+Lots of Negative Curve Headroom using Ryzen Master\n+Infinite Fabric can match high ram clocks\n+60 FPS+ @ 720p gaming in modern games\n+6 cores, 12 threads feels somewhat future proof\n+Low Power draw @ 65watts\n\n-I'm kinda mad that mine came with three bent pins that i managed to fix. Amazon's fault and i feel kinda cheated."", 'I paired this processor, Ryzen 5 5600G with my ASUS Prime B450M-A II and 16G of RAM. Before I installed the APU and RAM, I downloaded the latest BIOS from ASUS. After installing the BIOS, shut down, installed APU and RAM, booted up and it worked perfectly.', 'Funcionou perfeitamente e me surpreendi com a qualidade do produto,realmente é um processador mt bom,tem potencia pra rodas vários jogos,um custo beneficio de qualidade', '', 'Es increíble el rendimiento que se ofrece por el precio, en especial si consideras que incluye un buen procesador de gráficos que puede con multiples ventanas y tareas de edicion de graficos, audio o video, incluso puede con varios juegos populares, etc.\n\nAhora que en conjunto con una tarjeta dedicada, puede con la mayoría de juegos AAA en el mercado.\n\nTambién incluye su ventilador con pasta térmica listo para instalar, imposible encontrar mas valor por tu dinero.', '', 'If you\'re playing games at 1080p, and not doing insane tasks, this is the right CPU for you. I had one before the one I just bought, and not being nearly as experienced with computers, I never monitored its temperature and it likely toasted itself over time. The new one, however, is working like a charm. If I have a tip for you, it\'s this.\n\nStep 1: Go to the searchbar on the bottom left and type choose a power plan, and then open.\nStep 2: You\'ll see the balanced (recommended) one. Click change plan settings.\nStep 3: Click change advanced power settings.\nStep 4: You\'ll see a list with some plus signs left of various things. Click the plus sign to the left of ""processor power management"".\nStep 5: Click the plus sign next to ""maximum processor state"".\nStep 6: Click the number (I assume it will be 100%) and change it to 99%.\n\nBy following these steps, you\'ll limit the amount of power your CPU receives. Now, this isn\'t dangerous, provided you don\'t set the number really low. I first set it to 70% while following a video. Then I slowly increased it to 85%, and I noticed an insane drop in temperature (around 20-30c) while playing various games. Red Dead Redemption 2, for instance, was cooking my CPU beforehand, and then I turned down the variable and the high temperatures were gone. Now, does it affect performance in any way? It....can. The 5600G is a 6 core, 12 thread processor. When setting it to 85%, the base clock of 3.90GHZ dropped to around 3-3.16GHZ for me. I\'ve noticed zero affect on performance. If there is an affect to performance, it would be a few frames in games, MAYBE. If that. And for browsing the web, I have yet to notice anything. Now of course, if you\'re planning to use the 5600G as an APU solely (if you don\'t have a graphics card), then I would be a little more careful with lowering the variable. But if you have a graphics card then I wouldn\'t worry at all. Some people don\'t recommend the card because ""it\'s not good enough"", but how is it not good enough? It shatters web browsing, gaming, streaming, and basically everything that the average PC gamer does on their machine. If we\'re talking about more advanced activities, then yeah. You might want a CPU that has more cores, or one that is able to reach a higher speed and overclock. If you\'re planning to build a computer that is just gonna game at 1080p-1440p with some web browsing, Discord and streaming on the side, it\'s the CPU for you. Just pay attention to your temperatures. The last 5600G I had cooked under my nose. Ryzens get pretty hot.', 'Très bon matos et livré dans les temps...', '', ""Je possède ce processeur AMD Ryzen 5 5600G depuis 4 mois maintenant et je suis globalement satisfait de ses performances.\n\nPoints positifs :\n\nPerformances de jeu correctes : J'ai pu jouer à des jeux comme Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Bleach Brave Soul et Naraka sans problème majeur. J'ai obtenu des fréquences d'images comprises entre 60 et 70 FPS en paramètres graphiques élevés, ce qui est suffisant pour une expérience de jeu fluide et agréable. Il est important de noter que pour les jeux plus gourmands ou la compétition, il est préférable d'opter pour une carte graphique dédiée.\nParfait pour la création de contenu : Le processeur gère sans problème des logiciels de création de contenu comme Photoshop et Clip Studio Paint. J'ai rencontré quelques ralentissements sur Photoshop, mais un simple redémarrage du logiciel a résolu le problème.\nExcellent rapport qualité-prix : Ce processeur offre un excellent rapport qualité-prix, surtout si l'on prend en compte le fait qu'il intègre un GPU. Cela permet d'économiser sur l'achat d'une carte graphique séparée.\nFaible consommation d'énergie.\n\nPoints à améliorer :\n\nLes performances de jeu peuvent être limitées pour les jeux les plus gourmands.\nJ'ai rencontré quelques ralentissements inexpliqués sur Photoshop.\n\nEn résumé, le processeur AMD Ryzen 5 5600G est un excellent choix pour les joueurs occasionnels et les créateurs de contenu qui recherchent une solution performante et économique.
